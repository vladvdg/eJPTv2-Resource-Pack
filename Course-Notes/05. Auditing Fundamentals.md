## 1. Security Frameworks

### 1.1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework

The [NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework) is a voluntary framework developed by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. It provides a structured approach for organizations of all sizes and sectors to understand, manage, and mitigate their cybersecurity risks effectively.
The NIST CSF was first released in February 2014, in response to Executive Order 13636 issued by President Obama, which called for the development of a framework to improve critical infrastructure cybersecurity. While initially focused on critical infrastructure, the framework is now widely used across various industries globally.
The main goal of the NIST CSF is to provide a common language and systematic methodology to understand, communicate, and manage cybersecurity risks across different organizations.
The NIST CSF is composed of three primary components:
1) **Framework Core:** This is the heart of the framework, consisting of five high-level functions that serve as the foundation for cybersecurity activities in an organization. These functions are:
    - **Identify:** Understand the organizationâ€™s cybersecurity risks, including asset management, business environment, governance, risk assessment, and risk management strategy.
    - **Protect:** Develop and implement appropriate safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical services. This includes access control, awareness and training, data security, information protection processes, and maintenance.
    - **Detect:** Implement appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event. This involves continuous monitoring, detection processes, and security event analysis.
    - **Respond:** Develop and implement the necessary actions to respond to detected cybersecurity incidents. This includes response planning, communications, analysis, mitigation, and improvements.
    - **Recover:** Implement activities to maintain plans for resilience and restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event. This includes recovery planning, improvements, and communications.
2) **Implementation Tiers:** These tiers provide context on how an organization views cybersecurity risk and the processes in place to manage that risk. There are four tiers:
    - **Tier 1: Partial**
    - **Tier 2: Risk Informed**
    - **Tier 3: Repeatable**
    - **Tier 4: Adaptive**
    - Each tier represents a progression from informal, reactive approaches to well-established, proactive, and adaptive cybersecurity practices.
3) **Framework Profile:** A Profile represents the alignment of the Framework Core with the business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources of the organization. It helps organizations identify and prioritize opportunities for improving cybersecurity posture by comparing the current profile with a desired target profile.
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework continues to evolve, with periodic updates to address new cybersecurity challenges and emerging threats. It remains a foundational tool for organizations seeking to build and maintain a robust cybersecurity posture.

### 1.2. COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies)

**COBIT** (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies) ([official](https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit), [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBIT)) is a framework developed by ISACA for IT governance and management. It helps organizations align their IT strategy with business goals, manage risks, and ensure that IT investments deliver value. COBIT provides a set of best practices, processes, and tools to guide the effective governance and management of enterprise IT.
Key aspects include:
- **Governance and Management Objectives**: Divided into governance (strategic direction) and management (day-to-day operations).
- **Processes and Principles**: Structured around key processes and principles like meeting stakeholder needs and covering the enterprise end-to-end.
- **Enablers**: Includes processes, organizational structures, culture, information, services, and people that support IT governance.
COBIT is widely used across industries to ensure that IT resources are efficiently and effectively utilized to meet business objectives.

## 2. Security standards

### 2.1. ISO/IEC 27001

[ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.iso.org/standard/27001) is an international standard for managing information security through an Information Security Management System (ISMS). It helps organizations protect sensitive data by identifying risks and implementing controls. The standard is widely recognized and can lead to certification, demonstrating an organization's commitment to strong information security practices.

### 2.2. PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

The [PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard) is a set of security requirements designed to protect credit card information. It applies to any organization that processes, stores, or transmits credit card data. The standard includes 12 key security requirements, such as maintaining secure networks, protecting cardholder data, and monitoring access to information. Compliance is mandatory for organizations handling credit card transactions to prevent data breaches and ensure secure payment processing.

### 2.3. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)

The [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act) is a U.S. law that sets national standards for protecting sensitive patient health information. It requires healthcare providers, insurers, and their business associates to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals' medical records and personal health information. HIPAA ensures that this information is properly protected while allowing the flow of health data necessary to provide high-quality healthcare. Non-compliance can result in significant penalties.

### 2.4. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

The [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/) is an EU law that protects the personal data and privacy of individuals within the EU. It grants individuals more control over their data and requires organizations to follow strict guidelines on data collection, processing, and storage. Non-compliance can lead to heavy fines. The GDPR applies to any organization worldwide that handles the personal data of EU residents.

## 3. Security Guidelines

### 3.1. CIS Controls (Center for Internet Security Controls)

The [CIS Controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CIS_Critical_Security_Controls_for_Effective_Cyber_Defense) are a set of best practices for cybersecurity developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). They consist of prioritized actions that organizations can implement to protect against common cyber threats. The controls are divided into three categories: basic, foundational, and organizational, covering everything from inventorying assets to managing access control. They are widely used to improve security posture and reduce risk.

### 3.2. NIST SP 800-53

[NIST SP 800-53](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Special_Publication_800-53) is a publication by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that provides a comprehensive set of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations. These controls are designed to protect against various threats and vulnerabilities, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. It's widely used by federal agencies and organizations to strengthen their cybersecurity posture.

## 4. Security Auditing with Lynis

[Lynis](https://cisofy.com/lynis/) is an open-source security auditing tool for Unix-based systems, including Linux, macOS, and BSD. It is designed to assess the security posture of a system by performing a thorough audit, checking for vulnerabilities, configuration issues, and compliance with best practices.
**Key Features of Lynis:**
- **System Auditing**: Lynis performs a deep scan of the system, including files, configurations, and installed software, to identify potential security risks.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: It detects known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could be exploited by attackers.
- **Compliance Checking**: Lynis helps organizations check their systems against security standards and regulatory compliance requirements, such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and ISO/IEC 27001.
- **Logging and Reporting**: After the audit, Lynis provides detailed reports with findings and suggestions for improving system security.
Lynis is widely used by system administrators and security professionals to harden systems and maintain security best practices.
