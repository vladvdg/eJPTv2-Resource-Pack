# Footprinting and Scanning

<br>

## 1. Introduction

This process involves identifying hosts, scanning for open ports, and discerning services and operating systems - **a pivotal skill for the subsequent exploitation phase**. To master these techniques, a foundational understanding of networks and protocols is imperative.

### 1.1. Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model

The [OSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a networking or telecommunication system. It divides the process of communication into seven distinct layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of data transmission.

### 1.2. TCP/UDP ports

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** ports facilitate connectionless communication, meaning data is sent without establishing a connection or guaranteeing delivery. This makes UDP faster but less reliable, often used for applications like streaming or gaming where speed is prioritized over accuracy.
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** ports enable connection-oriented communication, ensuring reliable data transfer through error-checking and acknowledgment processes. TCP is slower but more reliable, commonly used for applications like web browsing or email where accurate data transmission is crucial.
- **List of TCP/UDP ports** - [IANA link](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml).

### 1.3. Stateful and Stateless Firewalls

- **Stateful** systems maintain information about the state of an interaction, allowing them to track ongoing connections or sessions. For example, a stateful firewall keeps track of active connections and allows or blocks traffic based on the context of the connection.
- **Stateless** systems do not retain information about previous interactions, treating each request as an independent transaction. A stateless firewall, for instance, makes decisions based solely on individual packets without regard to the connection's history.

### 1.4. Regex

[Regex](https://regex101.com/) (short for **Regular Expression**) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, typically used for string searching, matching, and manipulation tasks. Regex is a powerful tool for finding, extracting, or replacing text based on specific patterns, and it's widely used in programming, text processing, and data validation.

## 2. TCP/IP utilities and Network Commands

**These TCP/IP utilities and network commands** are essential for managing network configurations, monitoring network activity, and troubleshooting network issues on Linux systems. They interact with various layers of the network stack, from hardware interfaces to high-level protocols, providing a comprehensive set of tools for network administration.

### 2.1. IP command

The **`ip`** command is essential for managing networking tasks at both the Data Link (Layer 2) and Network Layers (Layer 3) of the OSI model. It offers a comprehensive set of tools for configuring interfaces, managing IP addresses, setting routes, and more.

```shell
ip addr show
# This command displays all IP addresses assigned to network interfaces.

ip addr add <IP_ADDRESS>/<PREFIX> dev <INTERFACE>
# This command adds an IP address to a specific network interface. Replace <IP_ADDRESS> with the desired IP address, <PREFIX> with the subnet prefix (e.g., /24 for 255.255.255.0), and <INTERFACE> with the name of the network interface (e.g. eth0).

ip addr del <IP_ADDRESS>/<PREFIX> dev <INTERFACE>
# This command removes an IP address from a network interface. Replace <IP_ADDRESS>, <PREFIX>, and <INTERFACE> with the appropriate values.

ip route show
# This command displays the current routing table, showing how traffic is routed on the system.

ip route add default via <GATEWAY_IP>
# This command adds a default route (gateway) for outbound traffic. Replace <GATEWAY_IP> with the IP address of the gateway/router.

ip route get <DESTINATION_IP>
# This command shows you the specific route that your system will take to reach a given IP address, including the interface it will use.

ip route del default
# This command removes the default route from the routing table.

ip neighbor show
# This command displays the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache, which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.

ip link set <INTERFACE> promisc <ON / OFF>
# Set your network interface into promiscuous mode.
```

### 2.2. Ping Command

The ping command is a network tool used to check if a host is reachable on an IP network. It sends ICMP Echo Request packets to a target and waits for a response, measuring the time it takes for the round trip.
 
```shell
ping <HOST>
# This command sends ICMP Echo Request packets to the specified <HOST> (which can be an IP address or a domain name) to test connectivity and measure response times.

ping -c <COUNT> <HOST>
# This command sends a specific number <COUNT> of ICMP Echo Request packets to the <HOST> and then stops. Replace <COUNT> with the number of pings you want to send and <HOST> with the target host.

ping -i <INTERVAL> <HOST>
# This command sets the interval between sending each packet to <INTERVAL> seconds. Replace <INTERVAL> with the desired number of seconds and <HOST> with the target host.

ping -t <TTL> <HOST>
# This command sets the Time To Live (TTL) for the packets sent to <HOST>. TTL limits the number of hops a packet can take before being discarded. Replace <TTL> with the desired TTL value and <HOST> with the target host.

ping -W <TIMEOUT> <HOST>
# This command sets the timeout period to wait for a reply from the <HOST>. Replace <TIMEOUT> with the number of seconds to wait and <HOST> with the target host.

ping -v <HOST>
# This command enables verbose output, providing more detailed information about each ICMP request and reply. Replace <HOST> with the target host.

ping -R <HOST>
# This command records the route of the packets sent to the <HOST>, but this is specific to IPv4. Replace <HOST> with the target.

ping -n <HOST>
# This command prevents the command from resolving IP addresses to hostnames, displaying the IP addresses directly in the output. Use <HOST> to specify the target.
```

### 2.3. Hostname Command

The `hostname` command in Linux is used to display or set the system's network name (hostname). It's primarily used to identify the machine on a network.

```shell
hostname
# Displays the current hostname of the system.

hostname <NEW_HOSTNAME>
# Sets the system's hostname to <NEW_HOSTNAME>.

hostname -f
# Displays the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the system.

hostname -i
# Displays the IP address(es) associated with the hostname.
```

### 2.4. Traceroute Command

The **`traceroute`** command is used in Linux to map the journey that a packet of information undertakes from its source to its destination.

```shell
traceroute <HOST>
# The basic command to trace the route that packets take to reach the specified <HOST>.

traceroute -n <HOST>
# Traces the route to <HOST> but displays IP addresses without resolving them to hostnames.

traceroute -I <HOST>
# Uses ICMP Echo Requests (like ping) instead of the default UDP packets to trace the route.

traceroute -p <PORT> <HOST>
# Specifies the destination port for the probe packets.

traceroute -m <MAX_TTL> <HOST>
# Sets the maximum number of hops (TTL) to be used in the trace.
```

### 2.5. SS Command

The **`ss`** command is a utility in Linux used to display detailed information about network sockets, which include TCP, UDP, and other protocol connections.

```shell
man ss
# ss Manual.

ss -t
# Displays all active TCP connections.

ss -u
# Displays all active UDP connections.

ss -l
# Displays all listening sockets (TCP, UDP, etc.).

ss -n
# Displays all connections with numeric addresses and ports.

ss -tuln
# Displays listening TCP and UDP sockets with numeric addresses.

ss -p
# Displays the process using each socket.

ss -tnl
# Displays all listening TCP sockets with numeric addresses.
```

## 3. NMAP

**Nmap** is a powerful network scanning tool used for discovering hosts, identifying open ports, and detecting service versions and vulnerabilities on a network.
- Nmap [website](https://nmap.org/)
- Zenmap [link](https://nmap.org/zenmap/)
- The **`nmap -h`** command is used to display the help menu for Nmap. This menu provides a quick overview of the available options and how to use them.
- Optimize Nmap scans by using Timing and Performance commands listed in **`nmap -h`**.

### 3.1. Nmap - Ports and Hosts scanning

```shell
nmap -sn <TARGET_IP>
# Check if the host is alive.

nmap -Pn <TARGET_IP>
# By default, Nmap performs a host discovery step before scanning.  If a host does not respond to these probes, Nmap might not scan it further, assuming the host is down. With -Pn, Nmap skips the host discovery step and treats all specified IP addresses or hosts as "up" and proceeds directly to the port scanning phase. This is useful in situations where hosts are behind firewalls or have ICMP echo requests blocked, which would otherwise prevent Nmap from detecting them as online.

nmap -T4 -Pn -sV -O <TARGET_IP>
# Service + O.S. detection scan. Nmap timing refers to the speed and aggressiveness of the scan, balancing between stealth and speed, with options ranging from slow and stealthy (T0) to fast and aggressive (T5).

nmap -Pn -sV -T4 -A -oN <FILE_NAME>  <TARGET_IP>
# Host discovery comprehensive scan + saving into txt.file.
# -oN > normal format, output.txt file.
# -oX > XML output format.
# -oG > Grepable output format.
# -oA > Output in all three formats (-oN, -oX, and -oG) simultaneously.

nmap -p- <TARGET_IP>
# This option tells Nmap to scan all ports from 1 to 65,535.

nmap -p <PORT_LIST> <TARGET_IP>
# Scan specific ports.

nmap -sS <TARGET_IP>
# "TCP SYN scan" or "Stealth scan," is a widely used for scanning and identifying open ports on a target system.
# Response from target: SYN/ACK > If the port is open | RST > If the port is closed | No Response or ICMP Error > If the port is filtered.

nmap -sT <TARGET_IP>
# Performs a full TCP three-way handshake. After that, Nmap sends a RST (reset) packet to tear down the connection and move on to the next port. The results are generally very reliable but it's less stealthy and slower.
# SYN/ACK Received > the port is marked as open | RST Received > the port is marked as closed | No Response or ICMP Error > the port might be filtered (e.g. blocked by a firewall).

# Example of a faster nmap command:
nmap -T5 -sU --top-ports 100 -Pn -n <TARGET_IP>
# Check UDP ports only. This command uses the fastest timing template, scans only the top 100 ports, skips host discovery, and disables DNS resolution.
# -sU tells nmap to perform a **UDP scan** instead of the default TCP scan.
```

### 3.2. Nmap - Firewall Detection and IDS Evasion

```shell
nmap -sA <TARGET_IP>
# This type of scan is primarily used to map out firewall rule sets and determine whether ports are filtered or unfiltered, rather than to identify open or closed ports.
# Filtered Ports > ports where no response was received, likely due to a firewall.
# Unfiltered Ports > Ports have responded with an RST packet, indicating that they are accessible but not necessarily open.
# Sometimes bypass simple stateful firewalls, which might not filter ACK packets as strictly as SYN packets.

nmap -sS -f <TARGET_IP>
# Is used to fragment packets, a technique designed to evade detection by firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS). 
# Might be used to bypass basic or outdated firewalls that do not inspect fragmented traffic thoroughly.
```

### 3.3. Nmap - Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

The **Nmap Scripting Engine** ([NSE](https://nmap.org/book/man-nse.html)) extends Nmap by enabling automated tasks like vulnerability detection and service discovery through [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)) scripts. Scripts are categorized into groups such as **vuln** (vulnerability scanning), **auth** (authentication testing), and **discovery** (network exploration). NSE is commonly used in security assessments to efficiently identify vulnerabilities and gather detailed network information.

```shell
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ 
# List of available Nmap scripts.

ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts | grep -e "http"
# -al > all files, including hidden ones, and provides a detailed list.
# | grep -e "http" > searches for the pattern "http" in the output and pecifies the pattern to search for, in this case, "http".

nmap --script-help <SCRIPT_NAME> | "*<keyword>*"
# To search for a script related to a specific task or service, you can use or to search by keyword.

nmap --script <auth, default, discovery, vuln> <TARGET_IP>
# You can run all scripts in a category by specifying the category name.

# Example: Some scripts require or accept additional arguments. You can pass these using the --script-args option.
nmap --script http-brute --script-args http-brute.path=/admin <TARGET_IP>
# This runs the http-brute script and specifies the path to brute-force as /admin.

nmap -sS -sV  -sC -p- -T4 <IP_ADDRESS>
# This command would perform a version detection scan and run the default scripts on the target IP providing detailed information about the services running on that host and potentially identifying vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

nmap --script-help default
# You can see the list of default scripts.

# To see available scripts in a category and get more details about what they do, you can use the following command:
nmap --script-help <category>
nmap --script <category> <address>
```

### 3.4. Common NMAP Script Categories

- **auth**: Scripts related to authentication bypass, brute force, and credential checking.
- **broadcast**: Scripts that discover hosts and services on the network using broadcast and other local network techniques.
- **default**: Default scripts that are run with the `-sC` option.
- **discovery**: Scripts for host and network discovery.
- **dos**: Scripts to test for Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities.
- **exploit**: Scripts that attempt to exploit vulnerabilities.
- **external**: Scripts that rely on external information sources.
- **fuzzer**: Scripts that test services by sending unusual inputs.
- **intrusive**: Scripts that might be considered intrusive or cause damage.
- **malware**: Scripts for detecting malware on the target.
- **safe**: Scripts that are generally safe and unlikely to cause harm.
- **vuln**: Scripts that check for known vulnerabilities.


### 3.5. Windows Recon: Nmap Host Discovery

Host discovery using Nmap (Network Mapper) is a crucial step in network scanning to identify which hosts are up and running on a network. In this lab, we will learn a standard method to discover hosts using Nmap.

In this lab environment, you will be provided with GUI access to a Kali machine.

**Objective**: Your task is to discover available live hosts and their open ports using Nmap and identify the running services and applications.

```shell
ping -c 5 <target_IP>
# 100% packet loss
# We can observe that the target is not responding to the ping requests, so this does not confirm if it’s alive or down.
nmap -sN <target_IP>
# Host seems down
nmap -Pn --traceroute <target_IP>
nmap -Pn -sS -O -sV <target_IP>
# We can see multiple ports are open on the target machine.
```

### 3.6. Scan the Server 1

Learn how to use Nmap to scan and detect open ports and services on a target network.

**Objective:** This lab covers the process of performing port scanning and service detection with Nmap.

```shell
ping -c 5 <target_IP>
# Target is alive
nmap -Pn -sV <target_IP>
# All 1000 scanned ports are in ignored states
nmap -p- -Pn <target_IP>
# Extend the scanning to all 65,535 Ports
nmap -p 6421,41288,55413 -sV -O -v <target_IP>
```


### 3.7. SMB Nmap Scripts

SMB ([Server Message Block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block)) is a network file sharing protocol primarily used for providing shared access to files, printers, and serial ports within a network (LAN). It allows systems on a network to communicate and share resources, commonly used in Windows environments. SMB also facilitates inter-process communication over a network.

Nmap [SMB scripts](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/).

**Objective:** Your task is to fingerprint the service using the tools available on the Kali machine and run Nmap scripts to enumerate the Windows target machine's SMB service.
1. Identify SMB Protocol Dialects
2. Find SMB security level information
3. Enumerate active sessions, shares, Windows users, domains, services, etc.

The following username and password may be used to access the service:
- **Username**: administrator
- **Password**: smbserver_771

```shell
ping -c 1 <target_IP>
# Target is alive

ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep smb

cat /usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb-enum-shares.nse
# Code and documentation inside the script.

nmap -p 445 --script smb-protocols <target_IP>
# Nmap script to list the supported protocols and dialects of an SMB server.

nmap -p 445 --script smb-enum-sessions <target_IP>
# We discovered that user 'bob' is logged in, even without requiring credentials.

nmap -p 445 --script smb-enum-sessions --script-args smbusername=<username>, smbpassword=<password> <target_IP>
# In case guest login is not enabled we can always use valid credentials of the target machine to discover the same information.

nmap -p 445 --script smb-enum-shares <target_IP>
# Scanning all shares using valid credentials to check the permissions.
# The IPC$ share is also known as a null session connection. By using this session, Windows lets anonymous users perform certain activities, such as enumerating the names of domain accounts and network shares.

nmap -p 445 --script smb-enum-shares,smb-ls --script-args smbusername=<username>, smbpassword=<password> <target_IP>
# Enumerating all the shared folders and drives then running the ls command (The ls command is used to list files or directories, similarly dir in windows) on all the shared folders.
```
