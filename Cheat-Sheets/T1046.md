**T1046 (Network Service Scanning)**Â is a technique defined in theÂ **MITRE ATT&CK framework**, used to describe a type of reconnaissance activity where an attacker scans a network to discover open services or active ports on systems.

# Using NMAP

```shell
# Uploads the local nmap binary from your machine to the /tmp directory on the target system 
upload /root/static-binaries/nmap /tmp/nmap 
shell
chmod +x /tmp/nmap
./nmap -p- <second_target_IP>
```

# Using Bash Script

```shell
# Save the following script as bash-port-scanner.sh

#!/bin/bash
for port in {1..1000}; do
 timeout 1 bash -c "echo >/dev/tcp/$1/$port" 2>/dev/null && echo "port $port is open"
done

# Upload the bash script on the target machine
upload /root/bash-port-scanner.sh /tmp/bash-port-scanner.sh
shell
chmod +x ./bash-port-scanner.sh
./bash-port-scanner.sh <second_target_IP>
```

# Using Metasploit Module

```shell
run autoroute -s <second-network-interface-on-first-target-machine>
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
set RHOSTS <second_target_IP>
set VERBOSE false
set PORTS <set_range>
