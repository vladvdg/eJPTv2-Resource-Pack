## Host & Network Penetration Testing: Exploitation CTF 2

### Q1. Looks like smb user tom has not changed his password from a very long time.
**Resolution:**  
Nmap reveals SMB on port 445. Use CrackMapExec to brute-force Tom’s password, then enumerate accessible shares with SMBMap. Connect and read files.

### Q2. Using the NTLM hash list discovered in the previous challenge, can you compromise the smb user nancy?
**Resolution:**  
Use the leaked NTLM hashes with Metasploit’s `scanner/smb/smb_login` module to authenticate as Nancy. Interact with the session, list shares, and download/read flag files.

### Q3. I wonder what the hint found in the previous challenge be useful for!
**Resolution:**  
Use discovered credentials to access the FTP service. Log in and retrieve the flag file.

### Q4. Can you compromise the target machine and retrieve the C://flag4.txt file?
**Resolution:**  
Upload an ASPX shell to the FTP (IIS webroot), launch a Meterpreter handler, access the shell via browser, and read the flag.
