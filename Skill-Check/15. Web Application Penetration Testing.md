## Web Application Penetration Testing CTF 1

### Q1. Sometimes, important files are hidden in plain sight. Check the root (‘/’) directory for a file named ‘flag.txt’ that might hold the key to the first flag.
**Resolution:**  
Test for LFI by modifying file parameter in URL to `../../flag.txt` and retrieve the flag.

### Q2. Explore the structure of the server’s directories. Enumeration might reveal hidden treasures.
**Resolution:**  
Fuzz directories with Dirb, find `/secured/`, and retrieve flag from `/secured/flag.txt`.

### Q3. The login form seems a bit weak. Trying out different combinations might just reveal the next flag.
**Resolution:**  
Brute-force login with Hydra using common usernames and passwords to obtain credentials and flag.

### Q4. The login form behaves oddly with unexpected inputs. Think of injection techniques to access the ‘admin’ account and find the flag.
**Resolution:**  
Exploit SQL injection by logging in with `admin'--` as username to bypass authentication and retrieve the flag.
