## Host & Network Penetration Testing: Exploitation CTF 1

### Q1. Identify and exploit the vulnerable web application running on target1.ine.local and retrieve the flag from the root directory. The credentials admin:password1 may be useful.
**Resolution:**  
Nmap scan identifies Flatcore CMS with login form. Log in with provided credentials. Use searchsploit to find an RCE exploit, copy and execute it, then list root directory and read the flag.

### Q2. Further, identify and compromise an insecure system user on target1.ine.local.
**Resolution:**  
List `/home` for users (e.g., `iamaweakuser`). Use Hydra to brute-force SSH with common passwords. Log in and read the flag file.

### Q3. Identify and exploit the vulnerable plugin used by the web application running on target2.ine.local and retrieve the flag3.txt file from the root directory.
**Resolution:**  
Nmap scan, identify WordPress. Use wpscan/nikto/gobuster to find plugins (e.g., Duplicator). Use Metasploit module for arbitrary file read to get the flag.

### Q4. Further, identify and compromise a system user requiring no authentication on target2.ine.local.
**Resolution:**  
During /etc/passwd read, find user (e.g., `iamacrazyfreeuser`) with no password. SSH into account and read the flag.
