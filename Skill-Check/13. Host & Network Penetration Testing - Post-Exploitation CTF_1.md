## Host & Network Penetration Testing: Post-Exploitation CTF 1

### Q1. The file that stores user account details is worth a closer look. (target1.ine.local)
**Resolution:**  
Exploit libssh with Metasploit. Read `/etc/passwd` for flag.

### Q2. User groups might reveal more than you expect.
**Resolution:**  
Read `/etc/group` file.

### Q3. Scheduled tasks often have telling names. Investigate the cron jobs to uncover the secret.
**Resolution:**  
Check `/etc/cron.d` directory for flag.

### Q4. DNS configurations might point you in the right direction. Also, explore the home directories for stored credentials.
**Resolution:**  
Check `/etc/resolv.conf` and `/etc/hosts` for flag.

### Q5. Use the discovered credentials to gain higher privileges and explore the rootâ€™s home directory on target2.ine.local.
**Resolution:**  
Read credentials in home directory, SSH as new user, exploit writable `/etc/shadow` (add password to root), use `su` to escalate, and access `/root`.
