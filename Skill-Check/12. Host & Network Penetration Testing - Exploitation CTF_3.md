## Host & Network Penetration Testing: Exploitation CTF 3

### Q1. A vulnerable service maybe running on target1.ine.local. If exploitable, retrieve the flag from the root directory.
**Resolution:**  
Nmap reveals FTP (ProFTPD 1.3.5). Use searchsploit to find exploit, use Metasploit to exploit ProFTPD and get shell. Read the root flag.

### Q2. Further, a quick interaction with a local network service on target1.ine.local may reveal this flag. Use the hint given in the previous flag.
**Resolution:**  
Enumerate local ports (e.g., with netstat). Use netcat to connect to service (e.g., port 8888). Use hint passphrase to get the flag.

### Q3. A misconfigured service running on target2.ine.local may help you gain access to the machine. Can you retrieve the flag from the root directory?
**Resolution:**  
Nmap shows HTTP and SMB. Use enum4linux to find uploadable share. Upload PHP shell, set Netcat listener, trigger the shell via browser, and read root flag.

### Q4. Can you escalate to root on target2.ine.local and read the flag from the restricted /root directory?
**Resolution:**  
Enumerate available shells and SetUID binaries for privilege escalation. Use suitable binary (e.g., /bin/rbash) to spawn a root shell and read the flag.
