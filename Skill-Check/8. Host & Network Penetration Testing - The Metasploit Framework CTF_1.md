## Host & Network Penetration Testing: The Metasploit Framework CTF 1

### Q1. Gain access to the MSSQLSERVER account on the target machine to retrieve the first flag.
**Resolution:**  
Run Nmap:  
```bash
nmap -sC -sV --min-rate 1000 target.ine.local
```
Identify MSSQL on port 1433. Use Metasploit, select the suitable exploit, set RHOSTS, and adjust payload for the system's architecture. Run the exploit to get a Meterpreter shell. Interact with the shell, navigate to `C:\` and read the flag file.

### Q2. Locate the second flag within the Windows configuration folder.
**Resolution:**  
Navigate to `Windows\System32`, list directories, enter the `config` folder. If access is denied, use Meterpreter's `getprivs` or `getsystem` to elevate privileges. Re-enter the shell and access the config folder to read the flag.

### Q3. The third flag is also hidden within the system directory. Find it to uncover a hint for accessing the final flag.
**Resolution:**  
Search for `.txt` files in System32 and subfolders:  
```bash
dir C:\Windows\System32\*.txt /s /b
```
Locate the flag file and read its contents.

### Q4. Investigate the Administrator directory to find the fourth flag.
**Resolution:**  
After privilege escalation, navigate to the Administrator's Desktop and read the flag file.
