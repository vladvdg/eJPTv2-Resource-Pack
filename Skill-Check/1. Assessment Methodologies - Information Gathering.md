## Questions and Resolutions

### Q1. This tells search engines what to and what not to avoid.

**Resolution:**  
The `robots.txt` file tells search engines what to crawl and what to avoid.

### Q2. What website is running on the target, and what is its version?

**Resolution:**  
Use Nmap to identify the server and its version:
```bash
nmap target.ine.local -sC -sV
```

### Q3. Directory browsing might reveal where files are stored.

**Resolution:**  
Brute-force directories using a tool like `dirb`.  
Check the `wp-content/uploads` directory for interesting files.

### Q4. An overlooked backup file in the webroot can be problematic if it reveals sensitive configuration details.

**Resolution:**  
Search for backup files using common extensions (`.bak`, `.tar.gz`, `.zip`, `.sql`, `.bak.zip`) with a command like:
```bash
dirb http://target.ine.local -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/big.txt -X .bak,.tar.gz,.zip,.sql,.bak.zip
```
Retrieve the contents using curl:
```bash
curl http://target.ine.local/wp-config.bak
```

### Q5. Certain files may reveal something interesting when mirrored.

**Resolution:**  
Mirror the website using `httrack` to find hidden or interesting files:
```bash
httrack http://target.ine.local -O target.html
```
Navigate to the mirrored directory and look for unusual files (e.g., `xmlrpc0db0.php`).
