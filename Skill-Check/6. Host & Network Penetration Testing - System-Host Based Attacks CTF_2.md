## Host & Network Penetration Testing: System-Host Based Attacks CTF 2

## Questions and Resolutions

### Q1. Check the root (‘/’) directory for a file that might hold the key to the first flag on target1.ine.local.

**Resolution:**  
- Scan the system using Nmap to identify open ports and services.
- Discover open port 80 with a redirect to /browser.cgi.
- Test for Shellshock vulnerability (Metasploit modules: scanner/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env and exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec).
- Set LHOST to your IP address, execute the exploit, and get a Meterpreter shell.
- Upgrade shell with `/bin/bash -i`.
- Navigate to `/` and list files with `ls` to find and read the flag with `cat`.

### Q2. In the server’s root directory, there might be something hidden. Explore ‘/opt/apache/htdocs/’ carefully to find the next flag on target1.ine.local.

**Resolution:**  
- Go to `/opt/apache/htdocs/` and use `ls -la` to find hidden files.
- Read discovered flag file with `cat`.

### Q3. Investigate the user’s home directory and consider using ‘libssh_auth_bypass’ to uncover the flag on target2.ine.local.

**Resolution:**  
- Identify open port 22 running libssh 0.8.3 via Nmap.
- Use Metasploit exploit: `exploit/linux/ssh/libssh_auth_bypass`.
- Set RHOSTS and SPAWN_PTY, run the exploit, and open a shell session.
- Navigate to `/home/user`, list contents with `ls`, and read the flag file with `cat`.

### Q4. The most restricted areas often hold the most valuable secrets. Look into the ‘/root’ directory to find the hidden flag on target2.ine.local.

**Resolution:**  
- Attempt to access `/root`, but get "permission denied."
- In `/home/user`, analyze files like `greetings` and `welcome` (binaries).
- Use `file` and `strings` commands on binaries to discover privilege escalation paths.
- Discover that `welcome` executes `greetings`.  
- Replace `greetings` with a payload (e.g., copy `/bin/bash` as `greetings`).
- Run `./welcome` to escalate privileges to root.
- Access `/root` and read the flag file.
