## Assessment Methodologies: Vulnerability Assessment

## Questions and Resolutions

### Q1. Explore hidden directories for version control artifacts that might reveal valuable information.

**Resolution:**  
Start with an nmap script and version scan to identify potential vulnerabilities:
```bash
nmap -sC -sV target.ine.local --script vuln --min-rate 1000
```
Check for accessible version control directories such as `.git` on the web server. If accessible, navigate inside to investigate.

### Q2. The data storage has some loose security measures. Can you find the flag hidden within it?

**Resolution:**  
From the nmap results, check for publicly accessible phpMyAdmin.  
Navigate to the phpMyAdmin panel in the browser, look for the `mysql` database, and review the `secret_info` table for sensitive information.

### Q3. A PHP file that displays server information might be worth examining. What could be hidden in plain sight?

**Resolution:**  
Use nmapâ€™s `http-enum` script output to find interesting files.  
If a `phpinfo.php` file is present, visit it in your browser to examine what information it reveals.

### Q4. Sensitive directories might hold critical information. Search through carefully for hidden gems.

**Resolution:**  
Review nmap and enumeration results for sensitive directories (e.g., `passwords`).  
Navigate to such directories and inspect files like `flag.txt` for important data.
