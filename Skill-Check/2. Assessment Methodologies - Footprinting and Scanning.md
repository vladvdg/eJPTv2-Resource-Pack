## Assessment Methodologies: Footprinting and Scanning

## Questions and Resolutions

### Q1. The server proudly announces its identity in every response. Look closely; you might find something unusual.

**Resolution:**  
Use Nmap to gather details about the server.
```bash
nmap target.ine.local -sC -sV
```
Alternatively, check the browser’s Network tab for server identity information.

### Q2. The gatekeeper’s instructions often reveal what should remain unseen. Don’t forget to read between the lines.

**Resolution:**  
After performing the Nmap scan, check the `robots.txt` file for disallowed entries.  
Use curl to access `/secret-info/`, then curl to `flag.txt` inside that directory.

### Q3. Anonymous access sometimes leads to forgotten treasures. Connect and explore the directory; you might stumble upon something valuable.

**Resolution:**  
If Nmap reveals an open FTP server with anonymous login:  
Connect with  
```bash
ftp target.ine.local
```
Login with `anonymous` as both username and password.  
Transfer the files found with `get` command, then read their contents with `cat` after exiting FTP.

### Q4. A well-named database can be quite revealing. Peek at the configurations to discover the hidden treasure.

**Resolution:**  
After retrieving credentials from transferred files, connect to the MySQL server (open on port 3306) with:
```bash
mysql -u db_admin -p -h target.ine.local
```
Once connected, list all databases:
```bash
show databases;
```
