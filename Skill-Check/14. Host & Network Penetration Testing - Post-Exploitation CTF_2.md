## Host & Network Penetration Testing: Post-Exploitation CTF 2

### Q1. An insecure ssh user named alice lurks in the system.
**Resolution:**  
Brute-force Alice’s password with Hydra, SSH as Alice, and read flag.

### Q2. Using the hashdump file discovered in the previous challenge, can you crack the hashes and compromise a user?
**Resolution:**  
Crack NTLM hashes from `hashdump.txt` with John the Ripper. SSH as cracked user, read flag.

### Q3. Can you escalate privileges and read the flag in C://Windows//System32//config directory?
**Resolution:**  
Check privileges with `whoami /priv`. Use PrintSpoofer to exploit SeImpersonatePrivilege, escalate to SYSTEM, and read config flag.

### Q4. Looks like the flag present in the Administrator’s home denies direct access.
**Resolution:**  
Adjust permissions with `icacls` to remove deny for SYSTEM. Access the flag.
