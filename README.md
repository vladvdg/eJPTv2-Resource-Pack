# eJPTv2-Resource-Pack

NE Security’s eJPT is for entry-level Penetration testers that validates that the individual has the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to fulfill a role as a Junior Penetration Tester.

This exam is designed to be the first milestone certification for someone with little to no experience in cybersecurity, simulating the skills utilized during a real-world engagement. This exam truly shows that the candidate has what it takes to be part of a high-performing penetration testing team.

**The eJPT evaluates an individual’s skills across various domains and objectives, certifying their mastery and understanding:**

1. **Assessment Methodologies (25%)**
	- Locate endpoints on a network
	- Identify open ports and services on a target
	- Identify operating system of a target
	- Extract company information from public sources
	- Gather email addresses from public sources
	- Gather technical information from public sources
	- Identify vulnerabilities in services
	- Evaluate the criticality and potential impact of identified vulnerabilities

2. **Host and Networking Auditing (25%)**
	- Compile information from files on target
	- Enumerate network information from files on target
	- Enumerate system information on target
	- Gather user account information on target
	- Transfer files to and from target
	- Gather hash/password information from target

3. **Host and Network Penetration Testing (35%)**
	- Identify and modify exploits
	- Conduct exploitation with metasploit
	- Demonstrate pivoting by adding a route and by port forwarding
	- Conduct brute-force password attacks and hash cracking

4. **Web Application Penetration Testing (15%)**
	- Identify vulnerabilities in web applications
	- Locate hidden file and directories
	- Conduct brute-force login attack
	- Conduct web application reconnaissance
